# Analyzing series with NLP 

In this project, I have conducted an in-depth analysis of a series using NLP and LLMs. I have independently scraped a dataset, implemented zero-shot classifiers, developed a custom LLM text classifier, applied named entity recognition (NER) to construct a character network, and built a chatbot designed to interact with specific characters. Finally, I have integrated all components into a user-friendly web interface using Gradio.

# Overview 
In this project, I have created 4 models, each containing the code for a different part of the project:

crawler: This folder contains the code for web scraping the internet to build a comprehensive dataset about the anime using Scrapy.

character_network: This folder contains the code for creating an intricate character network using Spacy's NER model, NetworkX, and PyViz.

text_classifier: This folder contains the code for training a text classifier that can classify text into multiple classes.

theme_classifier: This folder contains the code for extracting the main themes of the series using Zero-shot classifiers.
