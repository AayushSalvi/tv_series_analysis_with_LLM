My belly\\'s full-- guess I\\'ll go get me a boat!\\n I wonder if they\\'ll give me one if I ask.\\n Hopefully they\\'re generous.\\n I never once thought about it...\\n Do you suppose I can do it, too?\\n If I\\'m prepared to die for it?\\n Do what?\\n Do you think... even I could join the navy?\\n Navy?\\n Yes! Catching bad guys is my dream!\\n It\\'s been my dream ever since I was little! Do you think I can do it?!\\n How should I know?\\n No! I\\'ll do it! If I\\'m gonna be a chore boy for the rest of my life,\\n then I\\'ll break out of here and catch even Alvida-sama-- no, Alvida!\\n You\\'re gonna team up with him to catch who?!\\n Huh, Coby?!\\n You don\\'t seem to be Zoro, the pirate hunter.\\n Zoro?\\n Coby!\\n Who\\'s the most beautiful of all on these seas?!\\n O-Of course that would be--\\n Who\\'s this big chunky lady?\\n --Chunky? --Not good...\\n You runt!\\n Let\\'s go!\\n Why, you...\\n Whoops!\\n It\\'s not fair to attack from behind!\\n It\\'s not fair to attack all at once!\\n Gotcha!\\n Gum-Gum...\\n ...Rocket!\\n What?!\\n L-Luffy-san... What are you?\\n Me?\\n I\\'m a rubber person!\\n A rubber person? You can\\'t be serious!\\n You\\'ve eaten a Devil\\'s Fruit, haven\\'t you?\\n Yeah! The Gum-Gum Fruit!\\n I see! I\\'d heard the rumors, but I guess they really do exist!\\n You also seem pretty skilled. You a bounty hunter?\\n I\\'m a pirate!\\n A pirate?! Hah! All by yourself?!\\n It\\'s just me right now, but I\\'ll find some more sooner or later!\\n Yeah... Ten crewmen sounds good to me!\\n Ah, so you\\'re a pirate too, huh?!\\n Then that means you and me are enemies, huh?\\n --L-Luffy-san! Let\\'s get out of here! --Why?\\n You saw how powerful her club is!\\n In these waters, she\\'s the most--\\n I\\'ve decided to be the King of the Pirates,\\n so if I die fighting for that, that\\'s fine with me!\\n I\\'m the most what?!\\n T-T-The...\\n The most ugly, cragged old hag ever!\\n What did you say?!\\n I... I\\'m going to join the navy!\\n And then I\\'m gonna beat up pirates!\\n Do you even know what you\\'re saying?!\\n I do! I\\'m gonna do what I want to do!\\n I\\'m gonna... I\\'m gonna join the navy...\\n ...and catch your lousy ass!\\n You damn pipsqueak!\\n No regrets! No regrets! I said it! I fought! For my dream!\\n Well said!\\n That doesn\\'t work!\\n What?!\\n \\'Cause I\\'m rubber!\\n Gum-Gum...\\n ...Pistol!\\n The sky is so blue...\\n Hey!\\n --Yes?! --Yes?!\\n Give Coby a small boat!\\n He\\'s gonna join the navy! Keep your mouths shut and let him go!\\n --R-Right! --R-Right!\\n Luffy-san!\\n It\\'s the navy!\\n Oh, perfect timing! You should go see \\'em!\\n But I\\'m a pirate! I\\'m outta here!\\n Get serious!\\n I can\\'t just join the navy like this!\\n I\\'ll be captured instead!\\n Looks like we managed to get away...\\n Whew, that was fun!\\n Umm, Luffy-san.\\n If you\\'re heading for the One Piece,\\n --that means you\\'re going to the Grand Line, right? --Yeah.\\n That place is also referred to as a pirate graveyard, you know.\\n Yeah. That\\'s why I need a strong crew.\\n What about that pirate hunter guy? What\\'s he like?\\n You mean Zoro? I heard he\\'s being held prisoner at a navy base.\\n Aw, he\\'s a weakling?\\n Nothing of the sort! He\\'s as terrifying as a demon!\\n Why are you asking about him?\\n Thought I might have him join my crew if he\\'s a good guy!\\n You\\'re being reckless again!\\n C\\'mon, he might be a good guy!\\n He\\'s been caught because he\\'s a bad guy!\\n No! No way, no way, no way! Absolutely no--\\n Why did you hit me?\\n Just because!\\n \"To be continued\"\\n When I was little, I had a vision of a treasure map\\n and I always searched for that miraculous place\\n before someone else could beat me to it\\n If the world is going to change\\n before I can even attain my dream\\n then take me to the time when I knew nothing\\n so that my memories won\\'t fade\\n Hey! I\\'ll untie your ropes, so join my crew!\\n I refuse to team up with a pirate!\\n Oh, come on. You\\'re already known as an evil bounty hunter.\\n Screw that! I ain\\'t done a single thing I regret! And I never will!\\n So I ain\\'t gonna be a pirate!\\n I\\'ve decided you\\'re gonna join me!\\n Quit deciding on your own!\\n On the next episode of One Piece!\\n \"Enter the Great Swordsman! Pirate Hunter Roronoa Zoro\"\\n I\\'m gonna be King of the Pirates!\\n'"
