They can discharge varying amounts of electricity from their body to manipulate as they please, including regulate the voltage: 200 million volts being the maximum output (roughly in the range of natural lightning). Given the sheer destructive power that is inherent to lightning, this ability seems remarkably strong even by Logia standards and grants overwhelming attack power, as well as high speed and versatility; Nico Robin has mentioned that, among the many existing Devil Fruits, the Goro Goro no Mi's power is one of the few considered invincible. \nBy physically morphing into electricty, the ability user becomes intangible and can let attacks (sans those involving Haki or Seastone) phase through them harmlessly. Enemies are dissuaded from striking the user — directly with their body or a conductive weapon — lest they be electrocuted, thus affording a melee-combat advantage. By transforming fully, the user can move at the speed of lightning, allowing them to zip into and out of sight, cross large distances nigh-instantaneously, dodge most attacks, and overtake any fleeing target. Merging their lightning self with conductive materials (e.g., gold) to stealthily travel through them becomes also possible for the user, as does traversing thunderclouds in the sky. On top of that, the Goro Goro no Mi user, being wholly immune to electricity, can freely spawn it inside their body without repercussion; they can even restart their own heart with electricity in case they suffer cardiac arrest. \nThe Goro Goro no Mi user poses a great threat up close seeing as they can electrically shock and burn people on contact, but their electrocuting potential is not limited to close range, as they can conjure up vast amounts of electricity to launch as long-ranged blasts (or send through conductive surfaces like clouds), striking farer-off targets. These attacks can be shapeless masses of lightning, focused or spread out, sent directly at opposition along a forward path, or made to crash down from above like natural lightning; alternatively, the electricity can be given more distinct shapes, like animals. Beside lightning, the user may also produce thunderclaps by superheating the air, making it expand at the speed of sound. \nWhat is more, should the Goro Goro no Mi user gain access to naturally or unnaturally formed thunderclouds in their vicinity (as Enel had with the storm clouds spewed forth by his flying ark), they can dramatically boost the range of their abilities, to the point of showering entire islands with countless lightning bolts or creating enormous, dense cloud balls laden with so much electricity, they can destroy islands on which they are dropped. Traveling through such storm clouds is likewise possible. \nThe abilities this fruit grants also extend to other electric phenomena. The user can, for instance, use electric heat to melt metal on contact, then reshape it to their liking, as seen with Enel reforging his gold staff into a heat-exuding trident or when he temporarily liquified and took control of his flying ark's gold plating, to entrap his foe therein. Additionally, by combining his lightning powers with \"Mantra\" (Kenbunshoku Haki), Enel learned to \"read electric/radio waves\" (電波を読み取り, denpa o yomitori?) from the air, across great distances to gain a constant, radar-like sense of everything happening around him on a massive scale, letting him know the exact locations, actions, and conversations of anyone present on Skypiea at any time when concentrating, while massively expanding his attack range. Lastly, powering machinery that runs on electricity, whether a massive flying ark or robotic entities, is also possible for a user of this fruit's power. "}

Thus, whoever ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi becomes the natural enemy of, and counter to, whoever wields this Logia power, as the former's body is completely rubber-made. As a result, all of Enel's lightning attacks were shown to have absolutely no effect on Monkey D. Luffy, even those with voltages as high as 100 or 200 million. In addition, all of Luffy's physical blows that struck Enel completely bypassed the latter's intangibility, successfully hurting him even without Haki. It is unknown if other insulators have the same, if any, effect on Enel's Logia form. \nAutomata are also unharmed by Enel's lightning. In fact, being robots, lightning recharges them. \nMoreover, someone with their own ability to control lightning, like Nami using her Clima-Tact, can potentially deflect some of the Goro Goro no Mi user's attacks, altering the lightning's path, although Enel noted that Nami would be unable to do so if he upped the voltage. \nOtherwise, this fruit's user suffers the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses, like losing their powers if submerged in water or contacting Seastone, and Busoshoku Haki negating their intangibility. "}
{"id": 2, "url": "https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Goro_Goro_no_Mi", "category": {"category": "devil_fruits", "title": "Goro Goro no Mi"}, "text": "[Usage of Goro Goro no Mi]\n\nDuring his six-year tenure as \"God\" of Skypiea, Enel employed his powers to mete out his so-called \"divine punishment\" to whoever went against his declared laws or merely spoke ill of him, disclosed his secrets, etc., leaving especially the Angel Island denizens in constant and abject fear of his anger. Enel did so by using his high-level \"Mantra\" in conjunction with his ability to read electric signals from afar, which made his sphere of perception span the whole country: thus, he gained a radar-like awareness of all the happenings in Skypiea while extending his attack range massively. Enel would surveil Skypieans and listen in on what they were saying so that, should he hear disparaging conversations, he could immediately send down giant lightning blasts to smite the concerning parties from on high (his residence at God's Shrine); alternatively, Enel would take notice of when people spoke his name and then personally confront them for it. \nWhen entering face-to-face combat, Enel's powers are shown to make him extremely formidable. None of those he came to fight on Skypiea knew how to handle his Logia powers, with only Wyper (before Luffy) managing to hurt Enel once, by catching him unawares with Seastone. Given the immense speed of lightning, Enel in his transformed state has showcased great mobility, able move about and into enemies' blind spots untraceably fast, catch up to fleeing targets, and evade most attacks with no discernible effort (especially by combining such speed with the premonitive aspect of Mantra). He can even merge himself with and thus traverse electrically conductive materials, like gold, as well as move through thunderclouds. Perhaps most impressive, however, is Enel's ability to recover from being sent into cardiac arrest: should an attack be made on him that stops his heart, he can simply shock it back to normal. \nMost of Enel's offensive moves aim at dispatching adversaries by making overwhelming amounts of electricity pass through their bodies at once, usually knocking them out and inflicting severe burns. Most of Enel's seen attacks, both at short and long range, sufficed to instantly defeat whomever they struck, with Enel unaccustomed to enemies who can withstand more than one or two of his blasts. For some techniques of his, particularly those forming animals out of electricity, Enel uses the taiko drums on his shoulders as a medium, tapping them with his gold staff and making them glow before a given lightning creature appears from them, to assail Enel's foe. Against the rubber-bodied Luffy who proved utterly immune to electric shocking, Enel instead opted to use his gold staff in melee, infusing his weapon with electricity to reforge it into a sharp trident that exuded electrical heat to both slice and burn his foe, as well as using the gold integrated into the Ark Maxim to encase one of Luffy's arms in a massive gold sphere, permanently hampering the boy's movements. \nWhen using the thunderclouds generated by the Maxim as a medium, Enel could dramatically increase the range and scale of his lightning, creating exceedingly destructive attacks (namely his Mamaragan and Raigo) that could ravage and destroy entire islands. His ultimate move is shown to involve transforming his body into a gigantic version of itself made of pure lightning (his Amaru form) to maximally increase the strength and voltage behind his attacks. \nA non-combat use of Enel's lightning resides in his powering of machines, primarily his flying ark that has been engineered to run on electricity as a main power source (the gold from Shandora's ruins built into the ship to conduct his lightning); ultimately, Enel achieved his goal of reaching \"Fairy Vearth\" (the moon) on this colossal ship. Once on the Moon, Enel was able to channel his lightning to awaken an army of automata, robots kept in a dormant state, by charging up the machinery holding them across the ruins of \"Birka\". "}
{"id": 3, "url": "https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Hie_Hie_no_Mi", "category": {"category": "devil_fruits", "title": "Hie Hie no Mi"}, "text": "[Strengths and Weaknesses of Hie Hie no Mi]\n\nAs a Logia, this fruit allows its  user to transform into the element of ice, as well as create and control it on a potentially massive scale, especially to freeze their surroundings. Particularly potent even by Logia standards, with this power running for a ten-day battle it was strong enough to permanently warp the very climate of one half of an island into a frozen, uninhabitable wasteland. The Hie Hie no Mi's power is considered a superior counterpart to the Yuki Yuki no Mi's, ice being a superior freezing agent to snow. \nWhile other Logia fruits give their users the ability to dissipate out of harm's way by turning into their respective elements, it is interesting to note that this fruit is one of the few Logia fruits that can be hit with a physical attack. This is mainly because ice is a solid-state element, and thus, the user cannot simply dissolve out of harm's way as most Logia-users can with their fluid bodies, and it is slower in terms of reforming the body when damaged. However, most attacks are still ineffective against this fruit because its user can simply shatter and reform the ice composing them on impact. It is also apparent that the user can control the ice in his body to mold it and change its shape, as seen when Kuzan formed a hole in his chest before Whitebeard stabbed through Kuzan with his bisento, allowing Kuzan to avoid contact with the Haki-infused weapon. \nThe user can instantly freeze anything that comes in contact with them, whether the user grabs onto the foe or the foe makes contact with the user's body. If the frozen area is not treated properly and immediately, then the resultant frostbitten areas will suffer permanent tissue damage. If a body is frozen entirely, the victim can survive for a certain period of time, and can be saved if thawed out carefully, but will be left in a very brittle form that will result in instant death if shattered. In order to thaw properly, the victim's body must generate heat internally, by putting low-temperature water onto it continuously until defrosted, and then massage the frozen area; if external heat is applied, it will cause the frozen tissues to crack. Though it has not been shown, both Blackbeard and Garp have asked Kuzan to unfreeze their subordinates after he attacked them, implying that the user can manually undo the effects of the Devil Fruit. \nKuzan has resistance towards cold, due to his Devil Fruit's element, being able to move around in cold environments with barely any protection. The ice seems to cancel out with fire when they clash, as seen against Portgas D. Ace's Mera Mera no Mi. However, the ice seems to be ineffective against Whitebeard's earthquake abilities, since the freezing powers against the great pirate failed due to the ice shattering before disabling the target; the vibrations from the Gura Gura no Mi also shattered the ice and kept Whitebeard from being frozen solid. In addition, Akainu's magma abilities were able to melt the ice generated by Kuzan in seconds. However, it should be noted that Kuzan was able to fight against Akainu on equal terms for ten days straight. \nKuzan is also able to travel great distances and move at high speeds by turning his entire body to ice, as seen when he moved from his seat on the execution platform into the air to freeze two tsunamis created by Whitebeard. \nMost of this Devil Fruit's attacks require Kuzan to be in physical contact with his enemy directly to freeze them, yet Kuzan has found ways to extend his combat range, such as creating ice spears or ice tridents. Other than that, the user is also vulnerable to the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses. However, with the power over ice, this grants the user one of the few known powers capable of counteracting the standard Devil Fruit weakness of falling into water, as they can simply freeze the liquid and create a surface to stand on, thus preventing sinking and drowning. It's freezing ability also is seemingly countered if the target has sufficiently strong enough Hasoshoku Haki and the ability to defend themselves with it, seen when Garp's Haki prevented Kuzan from successfully freezing him completely.

With the immense power over ice, Kuzan can create ice weaponry or freeze his opponents with physical contact.  \nKuzan can create enough ice to freeze a giant, a Sea Beast, and convert a massive amount of seawater into a gigantic ice sheet within mere moments. He was even able to freeze two tsunamis (giant enough to dwarf the Marineford fortress) brought upon a seaquake from Whitebeard's Gura Gura no Mi. \nHis main style of combat is to use his ice powers to disable and immobilize enemies, freezing their bodies solid just by touching them, and threatening to shatter their fragile forms, whether by touching them directly or with extensions of ice pillars. His other main style is to create weapons of ice to spear his opponents, to compensate his otherwise necessary direct contact. He can also use ice to cause discomfort to his opponents. \nAnother usage of his ice that Kuzan demonstrated is for transportation across the ocean. He either freezes a large portion of the sea for other people to walk across, creates lines of ice on the water to serve as guidance for boats or creates a narrow track of ice for him to ride over with his bicycle, the Ao Chari. Kuzan is one of the few Devil Fruit users who has shown to adapt his powers for traveling over the sea. \nAfter losing his left leg to Sakazuki in their battle for the position for Fleet Admiral, Kuzan used this fruit's powers to create a prosthetic leg out of ice. This means that, even if broken, Kuzan can regenerate his prosthetic anytime thanks to his ability. "}

Additionally, despite having abilities naturally vulnerable to the fruit's power, Aokiji was able to deal grievous injuries to the other Admiral during their ten-day duel. \nOther ways the user can be hurt include if the user is touching Seastone, being caught off guard (assuming they not trained to transform by reflex), and being attacked by the fruit's elemental weakness (though no such weakness has been canonically revealed so far).

Similarly, just like humans, animals will become able to assimilate knowledge and utilize tools, the latter thanks to their now bipedal biology. Like other Zoans, this fruit grants the normal three phases of transformation, but the user will conveniently retain their human intelligence even when not transformed. \nChopper's usage of this fruit was the first to demonstrate that alterations to the traditional Human-Beast Zoan form can be manifested through sufficient training or the use of special substances. As shown by Chopper's utilization of these forms, a practical method for using this fruit in combat is to find ways to combine the user's increased intelligence with the attributes of their original, non-human body. Additionally, the full human transformation is shown to make the user quite large and strong, with Chopper in his full transformation being much bigger than his reindeer and especially hybrid forms, and like many other Zoan users he is significantly stronger in close combat when fully transformed. \nHowever, it does not appear that the user is capable of looking exactly identical to a human even if fully transformed. In Chopper's case, there is still a large patch of fur around his neck and shoulder area and he retains his blue reindeer nose; his full transformation has frequently caused him to be mistaken as a gorilla rather than a human and resulted in him being rejected by reindeer and humans alike.

These forms are called Walk Point, his normal form, Brain Point, his human hybrid form, and Heavy Point, his human form. \nWalk Point (脚力強化, Wōku Pointo?,  literally meaning \"Walking Power Strengthening\") is Chopper's form as a normal reindeer, useful for general travel on foot. It is called Sprint Boost in the 4Kids dub and Limb Boost in the Viz Manga, but it keeps its original name in the Funimation dub. \nBeing his original form, this is apparently the only form that actually ages as Chopper grows older. It is unknown whether or not his overall aging process is halted or even nullified whenever he assumed his other Zoan forms. Despite reindeer physiology lacking the vocal cords for human speech, Chopper is able to speak freely in this form, similar to a few other animals in the One Piece World like Pappag. During battle, Chopper usually uses this to run across the battlefield to dodge an enemy's attack or otherwise. During any other time, Chopper is completely disguised in this form as he usually looks like a pet. This form also allows him to track his friends or enemies more easily thanks to the reindeer's strong sense of smell. Chopper looks like a typical reindeer in this form, the only thing differentiating him from other reindeer, other than his clothes, being his abnormally colored blue nose, which is mostly noticed by other reindeer. His antlers are also non-pointed, as opposed to those of other reindeer. \nAt 9 years old, this form was relatively small and resembled a regular reindeer fawn. It had a short snout and no fur at the shoulders. At 15 years old, this form was more mature with a longer snout and prominent fur at the shoulders. At 17 years old, this form drastically matured and became more stag-like. Chopper's size has grown to a full-sized reindeer (at a size smaller than a horse), allowing others to even ride on him. His antlers have grown and branched out. His fur in this form is also notably fluffier. \nBrain Point (頭脳強化, Burēn Pointo?, literally \"Intellect Strengthening\") is Chopper's reindeer and human hybrid look, with a small body and large head. Chopper is smarter in this form, and is seen in it most of the time. When fighting against enemies, Chopper usually changes into this form immediately in order to dodge an attack due to its small size. In addition, he can scope out an enemy's weakness in this form, while he is under the influence of a Rumble Ball. In the Viz Manga, 4Kids dub, and edited Funimation dub, it is named Brain Boost, but it keeps its original name in the uncut Funimation dub. This is also the form where he does his best thinking of strategies, as he can utilize both human intelligence and reindeer sensitivity at the same time. Chopper is often mistaken for a tanuki in this form. This is also the only form that is posted on Chopper's wanted poster. However, due to its physique, Chopper was easily mistaken for a pet by the authorities, hence his very low bounty. In this form, Chopper is still physically strong enough to carry two large iron balls while running at full speed. \nThe named Devil Fruit techniques Chopper can use while in this form are as follows: \nHeavy Point (重量強化, Hebī Pointo?, literally meaning \"Weight Strengthening\") is Chopper's \"human\" form, which gives him a human-like appearance and height. In this form, nearly all of Chopper's reindeer physical characteristics are gone. Only Chopper's blue nose and parts of his fur remain. This form also imbues Chopper with peak human (primate) strength and agility which comes in handy in battle or otherwise, on rare occasions, this form has also been used to dodge in the air by turning into this form to fall at a faster rate. Chopper usually uses this form to try to blend in with other humans, but it is often mistaken for the Abominable Snowman or some other similar hairy hominid cryptid. This form is also mistaken for a gorilla or a yeti. In the 4Kids Entertainment dub, this is called Heavy Boost. While his voice stays the same in most of his forms, it becomes slightly deeper in this point; this point is given its own voice actor in the 4Kids English dub. It is called Weight Boost in the Viz Manga and in the edited Funimation English dub, but it keeps its original name in the uncut Funimation dub and some later chapters of the Viz Manga. \nAfter the two-year timeskip, Chopper's Heavy Point has grown much larger as well as more muscular, making him appear even more monstrous than before. In this form, he was able to block a powerful strike from a drug enhanced Dosun's hammer by punching it head on and receiving just a little bit of damage to his hand, the same hammer that smashed a building off its foundations with a single blow.  \nThe named Devil Fruit techniques Chopper can use while in this form are as follows: "}

The user is then able to launch themselves towards the opponent suddenly, allowing for greater momentum. \nDue to the reactive force of bouncing off a solid surface, the user can break apart said surfaces, as the Going Merry was split in half as a result.

Therefore, the potential of this fruit is dependent on the nature of the battlefield; spaces with walls and open floors may serve more useful than enclosed spaces or flat grounds. Lastly, the destructive nature of the bouncing may cause unwanted collateral damage depending on the power of the bounce.   \nOther than that, this fruit has the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses. "}

This yellow jawbreaker-like drug gives him several more transformations for three minutes by \"distorting the wavelengths of transformation\". These forms are most effective in battle against difficult enemies. \nWhile Chopper gains an edge in battle with these forms and the Rumble Ball, the number of the Rumble Balls Chopper can take in under six hours must be carefully monitored. If Chopper takes two under six hours, he cannot control which form he will become when he transforms. If he takes three, Chopper turns into a deadly form to both himself and others around him. \nAfter the two-year timeskip, Chopper only needs to use the Rumble Ball for his Monster Point. \nGuard Point (毛皮強化, Gādo Pointo?, literally meaning \"Fur Strengthening\") is where Chopper's fur grows out and covers his entire body leaving only his head and two legs visible. With this fur, Chopper is able to withstand against most outside attacks with this impenetrable shield. This form's fur also can only withstand certain types of attacks. This means any attack that is too powerful for the fur to withstand can damage Chopper even while he is in this form. As the guard is made up of fur, it is vulnerable to flames. In the Viz Manga, 4Kids dub, and edited Funimation dub, this form is named Guard Boost, but it keeps its original name in the uncut Funimation dub. \nWhile this form's defensive capabilities are high, it does not seem to allow Chopper to perform any sort of attack. So in order to attack, Chopper has to change to another form. In the anime however, Chopper has been depicted attacking in this form. By using the form's dense fur, Chopper attacks an enemy like a large furry moving boulder. Chopper was first seen in the anime attacking in such a manner against Hockera. \nAfter the two-year timeskip, the Guard Point has greatly increased in size, such that it was big enough to protect the Thousand Sunny from a blow from the Kraken's tentacle. As with his other forms, Chopper is now able to transform in this form without using a Rumble Ball. Although Chopper used a Rumble Ball to transform against the kraken in the manga, this was later confirmed to be an error. \nWhen Chopper used Guard Point against the Kraken, it was noticeably larger than when Franky used it after being switched into his body. It is currently unknown whether this was due to Chopper having greater control over his body than Franky, or whether Chopper is now able to freely control the size of the transformation. The Guard Point is also strong enough now to be able to block a direct attack from Big Mom, one of the Four Emperors. \nThe named Devil Fruit techniques Chopper can use while in this form are as follows: \nHorn Point (角強化, Hōn Pointo?, literally meaning \"Horn Strengthening\") is a form similar to Walk Point, but with larger and sharper antlers. In this form, Chopper's human arms are retained and also become bulkier (and covered in fur) in order to compensate with the large load upon his head. With these huge antlers, Chopper can use them for a variety of ways, such as using them as a large shovel. Chopper first uses Horn Point against Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas, labeling it his \"most powerful form\". In the Viz Manga, 4Kids dub, and edited Funimation dub, it is called Horn Boost, but it keeps its original name in the uncut Funimation dub. \nAfter two years, the appearance of Chopper's Horn Point has evolved and changed drastically. He can now stand on two legs in this form and the shape and size of his antlers have changed and grown greatly, though less sharp, becoming much thicker while resembling that of a stag beetle. His forearms are now larger (similar to Franky's pre-timeskip) and he now has hooves instead of hands. Furthermore, his legs and feet have a humanoid structure though they are still hooved. Chopper's face is similar to that of his Brain Point and he also has a hairier back. He has become taller as well and is now skilled with digging to the extent that he is comparable to Daruma of the New Fish-Man Pirates. It is unknown if he can still transform into his old Horn Point form. \nThe named Devil Fruit techniques Chopper can use while in this form are as follows: \nKung Fu Point (柔力強化, Kanfū Pointo?, literally meaning \"Flexibility Power Strengthening\") is a new form that Chopper added onto his options of transformations during the timeskip. The form is average in size, being a head taller than the average person, with a squat body structure. His face and head become wider, and he has no visible neck. The upper lip on Chopper's mouth also become angular and points upward, and his facial expression appears to be transfixed. His arms and legs are short and very muscular, though not as much as Arm Point. He bears some resemblance to the human inhabitants of Torino Kingdom, the island where he spent two years training. He retains his hooves and his antlers remain the same shape but appear to be slightly smaller. In the Funimation subs, the form is called Kung Fu Boost but keeps its original name in the dub. \nIn this form, Chopper is very proficient in kung fu, allowing versatile movement, and making him strong enough to easily take down several Ammo Knights that were sent to arrest him and Sanji. It seems that it combines the power of Arm Point and the acrobatic skill of Jumping Point though to a lesser degree than each individual point. In this form, Chopper has been shown to possess enough strength to easily break down giant steel doors.  \nChopper's voice in this form is his voice but with high-pitched yells. \nThe named Devil Fruit techniques Chopper can use while in this form are as follows: \nJumping Point (飛力強化, Janpingu Pointo?, literally meaning \"Flight Power Strengthening\") is where Chopper keeps his reindeer legs in a human-like form, which allows him to jump long distances. Its jumping capabilities are so high that even Sanji (who possesses great jumping power himself) was thoroughly impressed upon seeing Chopper utilize this form. This form is perfect for avoiding enemy attacks by allowing Chopper to dodge them by jumping high up in the air. The distance from which Chopper can jump into the air in this form can be quite remarkable that it can give him a massive advantage in height against opponents. However, despite its jumping capabilities, the form is relatively useless against enemies that can also move in mid-air. In addition, so far Chopper does not have any attacks that he can perform in this form. This form has mostly been used solely for evasive purposes only; in order to attack, Chopper has to change to another form. This technique is called Jumping Boost in the Viz Manga, 4Kids dub, and edited Funimation dub, but it keeps its original name in the uncut Funimation dub. \nArm Point (腕力強化, Āmu Pointo?, literally \"Muscle Strengthening\") is one of Chopper's most powerful human forms; his biceps, triceps, and shoulders become extremely muscular in a human-esque form and he retains his hooves. In this form, Chopper's forearms become powerful enough to inflict a great amount of damage. They are capable of destroying a huge rock with one punch. They also have a certain amount of durability as is shown when they were slashed by Chessmarimo with a technique that was capable of destroying a wall. Chopper usually turns into this form in battles in order to deliver a powerful punch to knock out his opponent. In the Viz Manga, 4Kids dub, and edited Funimation dub, this is called his Arm Boost, but it keeps its original name in the uncut Funimation dub. \nThough Chopper indicates that he can no longer access this point post-timeskip (and has not used it canonically since the crew reunited), during the Heart of Gold special Chopper used Arm Point when he was forced to combat a triceratops that attempted to attack Usopp. \nThe named Devil Fruit techniques Chopper can use while in this form are as follows: \n Before the timeskip, the consumption of three Rumble Balls in under six hours gave Chopper an additional Rumble Ball transformation, appearing to be a combination of all Chopper's Points except Brain Point (Heavy Point stance, Arm Point strength, Walk Point speed, Horn Point horns, Jump Point legs, and Guard Point hair). The form comes with an incredible increase in height, even dwarfing the already inhumanly tall Kumadori and Bartholomew Kuma. Thus, it is considered a type of gigantification, resembling a wendigo in appearance. It also has hands unique to all the others; he retains five fingers analogous to a human's, but each digit is replaced by a thick, long, black hoof in the shape of a finger. Prior to the time skip, his eyes were also altered in this form, becoming glowing cyan (red in Episode of Merry, Unlimited Adventure and Unlimited Cruise) with no visible difference between sclera, iris, and pupil. \nThe transformation grants Chopper a tremendous boost in his physical attributes. His body becomes incredibly dense and durable, as Kumadori could not harm Chopper with his Shigan and Rankyaku attacks, while Kalifa's Rankyaku simply bounced off of his face, all the while without any recoil. \nOffense-wise, he possesses immense raw strength, and according to Dr. Kureha, Chopper once leveled an entire village on Drum Island when he achieved this form for the first time. He was able to defeat very powerful opponents with ease, as seen when he used sheer brute force to smash through CP9 member Kumadori's Tekkai and then tossed the man's unconscious body several miles away; Chopper's roar alone was fearsome enough to disable some of Kumadori's techniques. Even Sentomaru was forced to use his axe (which he only does in the toughest situations), but still struggled against Monster Chopper. When Franky (in Chopper's body) began to rampage in this form, he was able to lift up a fallen, icy mountaintop and hurl it with enough force to knock a giant unconscious. Luffy was forced to use his Gomu Gomu no Elephant Gun technique to stop him (which had previously only been used to defeat opponents such as the Kraken and an Energy Steroid-enhanced Hody Jones). \nThere were, however, two serious downsides to this form. The first was that before the timeskip, Chopper lost consciousness upon entering this form, meaning that it was no more than a berserker state. Kureha even commented on this form being that of a true monster; a danger to friend, foe, and even Chopper himself. That statement reflected the form's second weakness: as Zoro observed, this transformation was potentially lethal to Chopper, as the amount of energy needed to maintain the form was too much for his body to handle. \nThere were only two ways to end this form: an unspecified amount of time passing for when the Rumble Ball wears off (a period of less than three days, given that he was sent flying by Kuma while in Monster Point and landed in his Brain Point form), or when Chopper's Devil Fruit powers are negated by standard Devil Fruit weaknesses such as seawater, as demonstrated by Franky when he blasted him into the sea. Either way, Chopper is rendered temporarily unable to move once he returns to normal due to stress placed on his body. \nAt first, this form was not given a proper name. It is referred to as Monster (怪物, Monsutā?) in chapter titles. In the Japanese version of One Piece: Unlimited Adventure, this form is called Overlimit Chopper (暴走チョッパー, Bōsō Choppā?) while in the Funimation English version of the game, it is called Rampaging Chopper. It is also unlockable in the game as a character in VS Mode, and is playable in the main story if Chopper is defeated in a boss battle after consuming a Rumble Ball, and if he is at least the fifth member to be defeated. It also appears in One Piece: Unlimited Cruise under the same name and is also playable in the main story, this time by consuming a Rumble Ball when Chopper's HP is very low, irrespective of how many crew members remain. Overlimit Chopper has tremendous amounts of health and strength, capable of taking many hits without recoil and causing massive damage per hit, but is extremely slow and has a small attack range. This form is equivalent to awakened Zoan in Impel Down seeing how it gives chopper tremendous power over every other forms of his. \nAfter the timeskip, Chopper has gained the ability to keep control of himself and communicate coherently while in this form which he named Monster Point (怪物強化, Monsutā Pointo?, literally meaning \"Monster Strengthening\"), though his voice is significantly deeper. It is now the only form he needs a Rumble Ball for and, by eating one, he can stay in it for three minutes. However, it still requires a colossal amount of energy to use; after reverting to normal, Chopper is too exhausted to move for approximately 2–3 hours. Chopper suggested that he can only use it once every six hours. \nThe named Devil Fruit techniques Chopper can use while in this form are as follows: \nLater with Caesar Clown's help, by improving the duration time for the Rumble Ball, Chopper was able to lengthen the amount of time he has with Monster Point to 30 minutes. However, the new side-effects cause Chopper to regress to an infant-based state known as Babyjiji (ベビジジー, Bebijijī?, Viz: \"Baby Geezer\") when the effects wear off. In this form, Chopper is small enough to fit in the palms of Tristan, a normal-sized person. For some reason, Chopper speaks like an old man in this state, further emphasizing the form's name. The side effects last for about 15 minutes. "}

However, Ko was successful as Simon transformed into multiple pieces of paper, and when he reassembled, his injuries were gone. \nHowever, Simon was unaware of this because he had lost consciousness. As he had no recollection of eating a Devil Fruit, he started to believe that he had been born with his ability and that he was a special being who surpasses ordinary humans. Eventually, when Simon tried to feed two Devil Fruit users, Luffy and Chopper to Shushibaruba, Simon was made to realize that he too was a Devil Fruit user when Ko warned him Shushibaruba would devour him too. Disillusioned by the revelation that he is not a superior being by birth, Simon deluded himself that he could become Shushibaruba, only to be devoured by the ancient creature.

Like with most other Logia fruits, when Smoker is hit, he can simply use the fruit's power to become smoke, thus absorbing the attack and remaining unharmed. Like some of the other Logia type Devil Fruits, it allows its user to \"fly\", by turning his body or the lower part of it into smoke, greatly enhancing his movement and speed. \nThe main offensive capabilities of the fruit stem from its user's ability to change the density of the smoke produced at will. This allows Smoker to surround his targets with his intangible smoke and then solidify it to grasp them. This power has granted Smoker his epithet The White Hunter. The smoke can also be used as a blunt weapon, hitting enemies with great strength. However, it is possible to escape the smoke's hold with a sudden, strong enough expansion of the body (such as Luffy's Gomu Gomu no Fusen). \nIt would seem that when confronted by fire, they will cancel out one another due to being the same temperature; other than that, no specific natural weakness has yet to be seen. With his current mastery over his powers, the only reliable way to injure Smoker is through the use of Haki, as Hancock did during their short battle, or through the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses. \nIt has been noted by many targets of this power that the created smoke is quite foul, to the point of causing people to cough.[citation needed] However, Smoker has so far not been seen exploiting its debilitating effects on other people's respiration.

He can manipulate the smoke's density to make it thick or thin, allowing him to hold and constrict others within it. Like most Logia users, he can fly by turning his lower body into smoke and propelling himself like a rocket. By the time he participated in the Summit War of Marineford, Smoker has mastered this Devil Fruit to the point of perfection and can turn into smoke reflexively if attacked. \nSmoker has shown higher understanding and skill of the basic mechanics of his Logia abilities than most other characters in One Piece, able to selectively transform and manipulate his normal and smoke body parts in tandem to catch enemies by surprise. One of his more common battle tactics is to turn into smoke, spread it over a wider area, then suddenly manifest his human body parts from the smoke to attack from unexpected angles. On one occasion, when facing Law, Smoker was able to fake his own death while turned into smoke after being impaled by a rock, only to manifest his human legs out of his transformed smoke body to surprise attack the Warlord.  \nAnother common tactic of Smoker’s is to transform his limbs into smoke, but not his hands, enabling him to strike opponents with his Seastone-tipped jitte from a much greater range, or to launch himself jitte-first at his opponents like a rocket by transforming his lower body into smoke. Post-timeskip, Smoker still employs those same tactics, but with the addition of hardened punches to his portfolio as well. \nSmoker has also been shown to power the engine of his motorbike, the Billower Bike, with his smoke powers, allowing ground travel.

When active, the user's body parts can take the attributes of trees, flowers, vines, etc., making them akin to a living forest. The plants created by this power can grow rapidly and be made to move around freely, seemingly not being limited by the rigidity and stiffness that some plants, such as trees, normally possess. \nThe user can generate large quantities of plants to unleash overwhelming large-scale attacks, like underground root tentacles that can ensnare multiple targets, or even enormous creatures such as dragons, at once. Additionally, those plants can rapidly absorb any liquid they touch, which includes dehydrating living creatures after impaling them, leaving them as shriveled husks. \nAnother benefit the user gains from the Mori Mori no Mi is the ability to use photosynthesis, the process commonly used by plants to convert light into nutrients, which allows the user to survive as long as they are exposed to light and water. \nThe user also appears to have direct influence on the environment's fertility, leaving behind a trail of various plantlife wherever they walk. The local levels of pollution do not seem to hinder the plant growth, meaning even a deadly, poisonous wasteland, such as the region of Udon in Wano Country, can become brimming with lush plant life almost immediately after a visit from the user of this fruit. It is currently unknown if this is passively active or something the user does on purpose. \nUnlike most other Logia Devil Fruits, this fruit turns the user into a solid element instead of a fluid, making it similar to the Hie Hie no Mi (which deals with equally solid ice). This means that the user is unable to let attacks pass through their body, though said attacks are still harmless to them if their opponent does not use Busoshoku Haki, as they can simply regenerate from wounds like any Logia. Should the user's entire body be destroyed, their regeneration begins as a sapling spouting out of the ground before rapidly growing and returning to their original form. \nWhile the fruit's power has an obvious weakness to fire, the user can train and adapt themselves against this fault by making their wooden body fireproof. That said, the user is still vulnerable to powerful enough fire techniques that can instantly incinerate their body. Aside from that, the user displays all the general weaknesses common to Devil Fruits. "}

This enables him to even fight as-high-as the large tree version he uses for combat. \nRyokugyu can also perform highly unorthodox feats with the plants he generates, such as growing a giant flower on his back and using it to fly by spinning it rapidly like a propeller. He can utilize Busoshoku Haki in conjunction with his plant appendages to increase their penetrating power as well. \nRyokugyu is also well aware of his natural weakness against flames, although as a Marine admiral, he has worked to circumvent this, even mocking those who fail to burn him down.

They can then be freely manipulated to either execute unique attacks or reattach them back to the body's remaining portion.

This is a convenient ability during battles since it allows the user to attack through enemy blocking attempts or avoid any incoming moves as long as they see it coming. The user is also able to live without being connected to vital limbs and organs of his body for long periods of time, as evidenced by Buggy's Crew Adventure Chronicles. \nAdditionally, the levitation effect given by the freeform control of the parts seems to extend to things in contact with the user, allowing them to bypass gravity by lifting objects regardless of how heavy they actually are for as long as Buggy has a firm grip on them.

Another strength of this fruit is that Bartolomeo can form solid constructs out of his barriers in various shapes, such as stairs which people can stand on, making this fruit useful for getting to hard-to-reach places. \nAccording to Oda, the barriers created can cover a range of 50,000 Bari Baris.

Buggy, having recently taken a treasure map from another pirate ship that showed treasure at the bottom of the sea, showed no interest in eating one, but Shanks then informed him that they could sell for 100,000,000. Hearing this, Buggy took the Bara Bara no Mi and made a fake fruit resembling it, and consumed the fake before the entire crew. Later, in one of the ship's life boats, he gloated to himself about his plan: selling the fruit for enough money to go after the treasure. Shanks then appeared, startling Buggy, who hid the fruit in his mouth to avoid Shanks seeing it. He expressed relief before Shanks immediately came back and startled him again, making him accidentally swallow the fruit whole. Realizing what had happened, Buggy raged at Shanks, only to be horrified when the latter pointed out his treasure map falling into the ocean. He dove in to retrieve it, only to find that he was unable to move beneath the ocean's surface due to his Devil Fruit. He was saved thanks to Shanks diving in and getting him back on board. From thereon, Buggy decided that if he couldn't get the treasure under the sea, he would use his new powers to gather all the treasure on land instead. Even so, when he reunited with Shanks years later during the Summit War of Marineford, he commented that he still holds a grudge against his fellow pirate for indirectly causing him to lose out on the fortune that selling the fruit would have brought him.

The darkness is visually demonstrated by a black smoke-like substance spreading out from the user's body. The darkness is a void that devours and crushes everything. Due to this, the user can absorb physical matter and attacks of any type by sucking it into the darkness. The user can also use this ability to irresistibly pull the opponent to them, regardless of their current state. \nSimilar to a black hole, the user can absorb things inside a vortex. It seems that it does not completely compress and annihilate that which is sucked in as an actual black hole would do, but rather creates some form of space where things are stored. Blackbeard was able to suck an entire town into himself, and when he eventually regurgitated, everything that was expelled was reduced to scraps but not completely destroyed. Living beings who are absorbed seem to be able to survive being absorbed and expelled, but become heavily wounded and left in shock by the experience. \nIn addition to the previous abilities, this fruit somehow has one unique and frightening ability that separates it from all other Devil Fruits: the ability to absorb and completely nullify the powers of other Devil Fruit users by simply touching them. All types, be it Paramecia, Zoan, or Logia, are affected by this, though Logias are the most affected as they can no longer become intangible by transforming into their respective element. Unlike seawater and seastone being only able to prevent Devil Fruit users from properly controlling their powers, and Busoshoku Haki users being only able to bypass the defensive aspects (such as a Logia's intangibility), the Yami Yami no Mi's nullification of Devil Fruit abilities seems to be truly absolute, as if the Devil Fruit users had never gained their powers in the first place. This was shown when Luffy's stretching powers were completely canceled on touch, allowing Blackbeard to injure the rubber-man simply by throwing him into the ground, while it was shown earlier when Luffy was stuck underwater that his neck could still be stretched above the water's surface, and that Busoshoku Haki can allow blunt attacks such as Garp's punches and a flick from Rayleigh's finger to cause him pain despite still being rubber. This essentially makes the user a natural enemy to all other Devil Fruit users.  \nWith all of the above, this makes the Yami Yami no Mi one of the most powerful and dangerous Devil Fruits of all. "}

Since the darkness also absorbs attacks, the user of the fruit is still vulnerable in battle, which does not pass through the darkness they turn into. If they fail to absorb an attack in time, the user can be hurt like any other normal human being or even more, as stated by Teach. Unlike other Logia fruits, the Yami Yami no Mi does not seem to give Blackbeard access to an elemental state where he can disperse, reform, or regenerate his body. \nWhile the fruit's ability to nullify Devil Fruit abilities is very powerful, it does not seem to be perfect. The user must actually touch and remain in contact with the victim for the effects to remain constant, meaning that if the victim is separated from the user's physical touch, they will quickly regain their Devil Fruit abilities. However, it seems this power can be overcome in certain situations. It appears as if the Devil Fruit nullification aspect of the fruit requires the conscious activation of the user, as seen when Whitebeard managed to activate his powers despite having his hand wrapped around Blackbeard's neck, with the latter noticeably being too panic-stricken at the time after receiving a slash wound from the Emperor earlier. It is also possible that Blackbeard is required to touch the other user with his hands, and his hands only, in order to nullify their abilities (as with the case of other hand activated Devil Fruits). However, it seems that touching bare skin is not required, as Blackbeard was capable of nullifying Luffy's powers at Impel Down by touching his clothes, overall suggesting that his hand must be touching the person or material on the person for it to work. This seems to be a non-issue, considering the aforementioned attraction ability due to his powers, if the opponent is strong enough to break his grip without the aid of their Devil Fruit, they will regain their respective Devil Fruit powers. \nOther than that, the user is also affected by the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses.

Only Caesar Clown possesses knowledge of how to create SAD, and as such, the production of these fake Devil Fruits requires Caesar's cooperation. After Caesar had produced the SAD in his lab on Punk Hazard, it was then transferred to the SMILE Factory in Dressrosa and processed into SMILEs. \nThe manufacturing process of the SMILE Factory involves having luminescent sunflowers on the ceiling that provide light to the ordinary fruit trees growing in the factories indoor orchard. Additionally, the SAD is poured into an indoor river. The river feeds into irrigation canals that channel the river under the trees in order to feed them the chemical, modifying the fruits that grow from them. The spots seems to be an indicator for the fruit becoming a SMILE, and while mid-growing, the bottom half of the fruit lacks the telltale spots. \nDue to the Tontatta Tribe's dwarves specializing in plants, they were forced into labor in the factory producing SMILEs. It appears that the Tontatta could only produce one viable fruit out of every ten SMILEs, and even they themselves noted the unorthodox nature of the fruit had complicated the success rate. As incentive to increase their rate of production, they were made believe that it was medication for their sick Princess Mansherry; the dwarves' gullibility led them to believe this lie. \nWith the destruction of both the SMILE factory and SAD supply, the production of SMILEs has stopped.

Like normal Devil Fruits, SMILEs render those who consume them unable to swim. It has been noted that, unlike real Devil Fruits, SMILE fruits actually have a good flavor. \nSMILEs do appear to grant enhanced physical abilities, much like real Zoan fruits, as seen when the members of the Armored Division were able to hold down the strong, massive General Franky mech suit. SMILE users can also gain certain abilities of their animal, such as Batman gaining the sharp hearing of a bat, Alpacaman being able to spit his saliva with high speed and force like an alpaca, and Gazelleman having the ability to run very fast like a gazelle. Of course, there is the possibility that a SMILE user will possess animal abilities that go beyond their level of resilience; Gazelleman is not granted the endurance of a gazelle, meaning that running fast will make him very exhausted. It is also possible for some manifested animal parts to possess abilities that are out of the norm of the actual animals, such as a lion capable of breathing fire. \nEven with the increased strength and animal abilities bestowed by the SMILEs, many, if not all of these artificial Devil Fruits appear to be greatly inferior in strength compared to actual Zoan fruits. \nAs noted by Law, SMILEs, being artificial, do have side effects. Due to the faulty chemicals used to make them, only one out of every ten SMILE fruits will successfully grant Zoan-like abilities at the cost of being able to swim. The other 90% of people who consume one will not receive a power while suffering the usual consequences. On top of losing the ability to swim, they permanently become unable to express negative emotions, being forced to smile and laugh all of the time regardless of how they actually feel, even while getting hurt in battle or if someone they care about dies. As opposed to real Devil Fruits, which lose their power after the first bite is taken and become ordinary disgusting fruits, the failed SMILE fruits will still maintain their side effects after being partially eaten, so anyone who eats from one after the initial consumer has already eaten part of it will also lose their ability to express any emotion other than joy. \nNotably, SMILE users are susceptible to the power of the Kibi Kibi no Mi, which allows the user to tame animals by feeding them the treats created via this power, meaning that if they are fed these special kibi dango, they will become obedient subordinates of the user.

An example of this is the scorpion SMILE user Daifugo, who has both multiple scorpion-like legs where he would have two human legs and a scorpion stinger at the end of his hair. However some transformations are so extreme, that it actually looks more like the human is growing out of the animal rather than the other way round, such as Fourtricks, whose transformations seem more like a human face and arms are growing out of a roosters rear. \nOne potential side effect is that instead of having animal features or limbs, some users will instead have an actual animal growing out of their body, as seen with Holed'em's lion, whose head and arms are protruding from Holed'em's midsection. Animals such as these will have a mind of their own, and this can be painful or even dangerous for the user as said animal may inconvenience, resist, or even attack its own host. However, since the animal half shares the same body as its user, it will share any pain its host receives, which will keep the animal from attacking its host too often. \nSMILE users, who gain non-sentient animal part transformations and don't suffer a severe body alteration, such as Sheepsheads sheep horns and Sarahebi's snake-like neck and fangs, have the ability to activate and deactivate their transformations at will. Alternatively, users who gain sentient animal heads growing out of their body, such as Babanuki's elephant and Mizerka's gorilla, do not have such an ability and their body is permanently altered. It has been indicated that users can achieve advanced control over their powers, but it is uncertain what that looks like. Since some animal transformations have their own sentience, a few SMILE users may very well give them a name, even though they share the same body, examples being Holed'em and Mizerka, who have named their animal transformations Kamijiro and Gorishiro respectively. \nAnother difference is that while SMILE users are susceptible to the Kibi Kibi no Mi's animal-taming powers, whereas a genuine Zoan user does not fall under the same weakness.

Of course, the animal traits can manifest in different ways, even for the same animal.

This power can also be used on living persons as well and can thus be used to deter opponents by creating doors on their body in order to immobilize them. \nOne of the greatest strengths of this fruit's powers, however, is that the user can also create doors through the very atmosphere itself. These Air Doors lead into a pocket dimension of sorts that is apparently within the air itself. This is ideal for escape or stealth purposes, since this dimension not only allows the user and anyone else accompanying them to travel across vast distances, but also provides a safe haven for them should they need to hide from an enemy or survive through large scale attacks.

This was seen when Luffy's face, after being turned partially into a revolving door by Blueno, reverted back to normal shortly after that. According to Blueno, this is because \"if a door is opened, it must close\". Also the Doa Doa no Mi is one of the few Paramecia Fruits unable to directly injure or kill the opponent, meaning it has very few offensive capabilities.  \nIn One Piece Film: Red, two other prominent weaknesses were revealed. One, is that using techniques like Air Door, which takes the user, and others', into an alternate plane, consumes a lot of stamina, and thus can't be used for extended periods of times. The other weakness is that the doors the user makes is proportionate to the user's size. As the current user, Blueno, is a large man, this normally does not present a problem and allows normal sized people easy access. However, should the user shrink, as Uta did to Blueno during the events of the movie, the doors he make will be much smaller too.  \nOther than that, the fruit is weak against the standard Devil Fruit weakness.

The user can produce these poisons in both liquid and gaseous states. They also become totally immune to any and all poisons, be it their own or an external toxin. \nThe user can create massive amounts of liquid poison that they can shape into gigantic, monstrous entities, such as a hydra or a demon. A large amount of poison can also be used as a means of transportation, allowing the user to travel through it like a pneumatic tube. The user can also cover themself with a thick layer of liquid poison, giving them a virtual suit of armor. Said armor does not offer much fortitude, but it does dissuade opponents from attacking the user directly for fear of being poisoned. \nThe effects of the poisons used, however, can be cured using an antidote. However, the difficulty of this task depends on the poisons used; a single poison can be relatively simple to cure, but having an accumulation of multiple poisons can make the creation of an antidote a daunting, nigh-impossible task, often an excruciating process lasting multiple days. Furthermore, any careless attempts to cure the ailments brought upon by the poisoning can hasten the death of the victim. \nThe most powerful poison the power can produce is called Kinjite, which Magellan himself has stated is powerful enough to \"destroy Impel Down itself\". Not only is this poison more lethal and fast-acting than most, it also spreads out from any surface it touches, literally \"infecting\" all objects in its wake, including stone. "}

If the user consumes their own poison, the tainted food would affect the user's bowel movements. Magellan in particular likes to add poison to his food for flavor, giving incessant diarrhea causing him to spend approximately ten hours a day on the toilet. This is especially problematic as Magellan is very fond of the poisoned food, disrupting his work and lifestyle. \nAs another weakness, it is shown that fire has some neutralizing effect on the liquid poison the user makes. Certain materials, such as Mr. 3's wax, are also resistant to most of his poisons, though the special Kinjite poison is still able to penetrate it and even stone (given its corrosive properties). \nA mix of different poisons can mean near-certain death depending on the poisons used, but some people can be cured of the poison if their body's natural strength is pushed. In cases where the victim has survived the poison, either by sheer luck or by being put through an accelerated healing process, they may develop antibodies that makes them greatly (though not absolutely) resistant to further poisoning. Additionally, the large amount of poison generated makes the user a threat to allies, and even nearby bystanders can, for example, start suffocating on the user's toxic breath if the user is careless while using their abilities. \nOther than that, the user is also affected by the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses.

The only problem with this, however, is that while the poisoned food will not kill him, it gives him a severe case of diarrhea. His level of diarrhea may be related to the amount of poison he consumes. \nWhen putting up with Hannyabal's antics, or any complaints from others, Magellan often uses the simplest form of offense the Devil Fruit provides, his own breath turned into poison. With this, he simply breathes mild poison gas on his subordinates to put them back into place. \nWhen serious, Magellan can use the fruit's powers to attack by producing and manipulating poison from his body. With this, he can promptly exercise his authority on prisoners as their executioner. Magellan can simply poison someone by breathing or using a complex move. \nTo prevent his enemies from running away or to trap them, Magellan can use his liquid poison to create a wall to block the exits of a building. Any object used to break Magellan's poison door simply goes into the poison which absorbs and dissolves it. However, Blackbeard could absorb the poison with his darkness, proving this blockade is not absolute. \nIn battle, Magellan can coat himself in liquid poison to serve as armor, preventing any opponent from easily landing any direct physical attack without getting poisoned in the process. Despite being coated, Magellan has enough control over his powers to enable him to delicately handle small objects while in this state, as seen when he held a Baby Den Den Mushi close to his face with his armor active without killing it. \nAside from lethal poison, Magellan can also produce different types of poison that affect his opponents' senses.

The user can channel their ink through brushes to paint; although if they lack a brush, their hair has been shown to also suffice. The user can change the color of the ink they generate at will for aesthetic purposes. \nOnce the user has drawn an object, they are capable of transforming the drawing into a three-dimensional object which possesses the same properties as the real-life subject it is based on, or a different property if the user so wishes, such as drawings of humans and animals gaining a consciousness, drawings of weapons having the same effect as their real-life counterparts, and drawings of food being edible and sustaining (albeit with a bad taste), among other things. The user thus becomes capable of creating an unfathomably wide range of objects to support them in just about any situation. The user is also capable of reversing the typical process of the power by transforming their own body into a two-dimensional drawing, which has been shown to aid them in hiding. \nThe user is able to fully control the living creatures they draw and can speak through them, allowing them to create fighters to aid them in combat or attack on a different front. It appears that the user shares the senses of the creatures they create, allowing them to know what is happening around a drawing if it is separated from them. Provided the user sufficiently knows the appearance of a person, they can create perfect replicas of people, including themselves, to fool enemies; the replicas will even possess the same voice as the person they are emulating. The user can also shroud themselves inside a drawing of another person, allowing them to go around under the guise of someone else. While the accuracy is unknown, Orochi believes that the user can transfer their consciousness into a drawing when their real body dies. \nDrawings do not bleed nor possess internal organs, so deceptive clones can best be exposed by cutting them. However, this makes it harder to fully take down a replica, as they do not feel pain and can remain alive and moving even when severely disfigured, with some of Kanjuro's living drawings being active even while missing heads. Ultimately, though, it appears that a living drawing will dissolve once it takes a sufficient amount of damage, as shown when Kanjuro's Kozuki Oden drawing disappeared after blowing up dynamite on its body. Finally, drawings will instantly dissolve whenever the user wishes. "}

The poorly-drawn birds that Kanjuro created in Dressrosa struggled to fly and carry people, whereas the perfectly-drawn crane he created in Wano was not shown laboring at all. If a drawing becomes too exhausted, it will revert back to its nonliving, two-dimensional state. \nThe drawings have shown a certain degree of weakness to water. On Zou, a large stream of water dissolved a cat that Kanjuro had drawn, but in Wano, Kanjuro's drawings were not shown to be affected by a heavy downpour of rain. Given that the cat in the former instance was poorly drawn, the drawing quality may impact the drawing's susceptibility to water, or another possibility is that drawings in general are capable of surviving rain showers but not standing water and large deluges. \nManually controlling a drawing remotely takes a toll on the user's energy.

However, he is actually an extremely skilled artist, able to draw life-like creatures including human beings. Despite having spent years acting like a mediocre artist, his true skills did not deteriorate, as he was able to produce perfect drawings once he ceased his act. When the Nine Red Scabbards sailed out to Onigashima to confront Kaidou, Kanjuro sent a perfectly drawn clone of himself with them, with none of them noticing until Kin'emon decapitated the drawing. The speed and precision of Kanjuro's artistry are also impressive, as he was able to draw a large crane in an instant. His created animals are as capable as real ones, if not more, such as snakes with powerful constricting strength or elegantly flying cranes. Furthermore, Kanjuro hid his powers' more potent usages from the Kozuki Family, such as generating ink from his hair to create a rain of hardened ink droplets. \nKanjuro can also combine his acting skills with his paintings to create psychological attacks, as he did so by animating a painting of Kozuki Oden and using his knowledge of the daimyo's personality to create a persuasive illusion of him.

It allows the levitation of these objects, regardless of how heavy they are. Essentially, this ability is identical to telekinesis. \nThe abilities of this Devil Fruit allow Shiki to control nearby objects, including ones as large as warships. Once an object has been levitated, it will remain floating until he commands otherwise. The affected objects in question does not have to be in close proximity with Shiki himself in order to maintain the effect, evident by the fact that he was able to keep the floating islands of Merveille suspended high in the sky even while he is sailing elsewhere on his flying ship. The ability to fly gives him a great advantage in combat, because it enables him to avoid many different types of attacks with relative ease, while he can attack from a distance with his swords or with his own powers. He also can use big objects like rocks to block attacks. \nHe can use his Devil Fruit power in a variety of forms, like dropping huge objects onto his enemies or raising and crushing the land on which they are standing, to sending out relayed messages by sending a tone dial to the receiver's direction. In addition, he has also used his power to manipulate and remodel the surrounding environment, such as fashioning stone, debris and snow into roaring lions which charge onto the enemy. Shiki can even make water float to drown enemies in it. With the incredible versatility of this ability, this makes the Fuwa Fuwa no Mi one of the most powerful Paramecia-type Devil Fruits. \nThe main weakness of the fruit is that the user cannot make living things (except himself) levitate. Another weakness is the user can only control things that have been previously touched. Also, like some other Paramecia fruits, if the user is forcibly made to lose consciousness, the objects that this power affected will instantly cease to levitate, which, as seen with the fall of Merveille, can have very dangerous consequences.

This was best seen when Franky threatened to shoot Funkfreed in the face.

The user becomes almost completely immune to blunt damage, including bodily attacks, blunt weapons, bullets, and even cannonballs, all of which will simply bounce off from their skin. Additionally, falls from great heights and heavy collisions that would kill a normal person end up being non-lethal or even painless, and certain traps and hazards are rendered ineffective considering the user's enhanced flexibility. \nThe fruit enables all parts of the consumer's body to behave like rubber, including their organs. This means that certain actions that otherwise would be impossible to do with a normal human body, such as pumping one's own blood or bones with air, can be achieved through this ability for extra speed or power. Furthermore, thanks to rubber's natural insulating properties, the user is also immune to electrical attacks, such as those from the Goro Goro no Mi, the Mink Tribe's Electro ability, and the special homie Zeus. Such immunity to electricity allows the Gomu Gomu no Mi's user to physically touch and hit the user of the Goro Goro no Mi (a lightning Logia) without needing Haki. \nThe user's ability to stretch and twist like rubber to extreme lengths not only makes them immune to injuries that originate from such, but it also grants them the skill to rebound from hard surfaces or reach people that are far away from their position. For offense, stretching allows the user to drastically increase the range of what would otherwise be considered a powerful close-range attack, turning it into a devastating mid-range or long-range attack. A stretched limb can be used to store potential energy like a stretched spring, increasing the velocity by stretching their arm back, resulting in increased power.  \nLuffy has shown a limited ability of moving in mid-air, by grabbing onto something with an extended limb and pulling himself away from what could have been a fatal attack. This gives the user the option of several jumping and airborne attacks that would have been disadvantageous to most other people. \nIn the anime, Luffy has used his stretching abilities to inhale great amounts of air to thus exhale a big gust of wind; this application of his powers was used to blow away Marigold's poisonous vapor from her venom spit and Magellan's poison breath.

Kaidou has likened its awakening to the Zoan's transformation abilities and the Paramecia's environmental alteration, even elements like natural lightning. However, unique to this fruit is that it can extend to living beings, as Luffy could influence flesh as if it was rubber too. Considering it similar to his previous Gears using the fruit, and initially unaware of its true nature, Luffy dubbed his awakening as \"Gear 5\". In this state, his rubbery body gains irregular adaptability that even stupefied the battle-hardened Kaidou. \nAccording to the Five Elders, the fruit had not been awakened for centuries prior to Luffy's having done so. They believed that preventing the fruit from awakening would be worth incurring the wrath of Kaidou, one of the Four Emperors, suggesting that they greatly fear the fruit's power.

It should be noted, however, that only after Ace's death did Whitebeard wholly attempt to erase Marineford in his anger. However, it was Blackbeard who truly was willing to annihilate the island using both of his Devil Fruit powers. Although neither man succeeded in sinking the island, with both having been stopped and the latter lacking enough control over the power, the resulting aftershocks and tsunami were felt far away from Marineford. \nWhen Blackbeard took this Devil Fruit's power through an unknown method, he claimed that with the power of quakes which \"brings destruction to all\" combined with the darkness that \"reduces anything to nothingness\", he was truly invincible and the strongest. \nHowever, this Devil Fruit's powers are noted to be a hazard to both friend and foe alike, as observed by both the Whitebeard and Blackbeard Pirates. This primarily stems from how, even though the user seems to be able to control both the magnitude of the shock wave and its point of impact, the quakes produced by these shock waves are indiscriminate in their effects. Because of this, allies of the user must be prepared for the impacts unless they want to become unintended victims of them. \nThis Devil Fruit also allows its user to forcibly take hold of any medium, allowing them to \"crack\" or \"pull\" on normally intangible objects such as the air itself. \nThis Devil Fruit has no apparent weakness, aside from the standard Paramecia Devil Fruit weaknesses. However, the three Admirals managed to stop Whitebeard's shockwaves from hitting Marineford's execution platform by combining their advanced Busoshoku Haki. Also, the siege wall that Sengoku planted was composed of a material which Whitebeard's shockwaves could not shatter.

One major risk of the user's powers is that their stretched limbs take a moment to retract back into place, leaving them vulnerable to attacks in the moments when their limbs are stretched, as Buggy and Kuro both took advantage of early on in the series. Luffy, however, has adapted his fighting style to minimize this risk. \nInitially, the user's body was similar to a rubber band, requiring him to use excessive motion to \"throw\" an attack. After the timeskip though, the extra movement became unnecessary, and Luffy is able to stretch easily. Additionally, rubber has a maximum limit to how far it can stretch; in the first SBS, Oda stated that the user's maximum stretching distance is \"72 Gomu Gomus\". Attempting to go beyond this length can cause the user to bleed and be at risk of ripping. \nOne of the biggest weaknesses that Gomu Gomu no Mi users possess is their susceptibility to cutting attacks and bladed weapons. By his own admission to Enel (much to Nami's annoyance) and as evidenced against Cracker, Katakuri and Kaidou, it has been consistently portrayed that Luffy has a vulnerability to cutting attacks. It should be noted however that this does not mean that Gomu Gomu no Mi users are weaker to these things than the average person (and in fact, Luffy is fairly durable even against bladed attacks). However, the Gomu Gomu no Mi's effectiveness against blunt attacks simply does not apply to cutting attacks (even when coated by Haki), allowing them to deal critical damage to Luffy. \nWhile the user is normally highly resistant to blunt attacks, things like Fish-Man Karate and Seastone are able to bypass this durability. While contact with water or Seastone drains the user of his energy and nullifies his rubber-like ability to absorb blunt attacks (as with Smoker's jutte), his actual body still maintains its rubber-like nature, allowing a third party to stretch his body for him. \nJust like other Devil Fruit users, the user is also susceptible to Busoshoku Haki. However, the usage of Haki only nullifies the user's ability to absorb blunt attacks; it does not revert the user's body to normal flesh. Through the use of Busoshoku Haki, Luffy's grandfather Garp was able to hurt him using only his fist (though Garp attributed this to \"love\"). When Luffy's crewmates (usually Nami) get angry at him, their punches are able to bypass Luffy's immunity to blunt attacks, although this is purely for comedic effect. \nAnother shortcoming noted by Doflamingo is that when Busoshoku Haki is applied to a part of Luffy's body, it stops being rubbery. This is proven with Luffy's Gomu Gomu no Thor Elephant Gun, where, despite rubber being a natural insulator of electricity, the Busoshoku Haki-enhanced attack itself discharges it. However, this weakness is negated by Gear 4, which harmonizes Luffy's rubbery body with his Haki, making him similar to an \"iron balloon\". \nComing into contact with a user of the Yami Yami no Mi, which has the power to completely nullify all other Devil Fruit powers, outright disables a Gomu Gomu no Mi's rubbery defense. This was shown when Blackbeard simply grabbed Luffy with his hand and then tossed him into the ground, causing him to bleed. "}

Though he had an idea of how they would work, Luffy had trouble with aiming and the timing of his attacks, and he was continuously sent spinning by the recoil. However, he managed to counter these weaknesses with his continuous training in the jungle by the time he left to be a pirate. \nThe powers of the fruit have been used by Luffy in a variety of ways. These range from simply moving from one place to another in a rather reckless manner, to attacking an enemy with a barrage of fast and strong punches. He has also developed several peculiar methods of combat as time passed, adapting new forms by manipulating his elastic body, most prominent his \"Gear 2\" and \"Gear 3\" forms, allowing him to momentarily increase his strength in combat. After the timeskip, he has learned to use Haki in conjunction with the fruit's powers, as well as having more control over his forms. Later, during the time skip, Luffy developed a form known as \"Gear 4\". \nOf course, Luffy, being who he is, does not only use his ability for battle. When with his crew, or even when partying with others, Luffy tends to use his elastic properties for the amusement of others, such as making funny faces, or using his elastic body to play around. Often throughout the series he would stretch his arm and steal food from others, much to their annoyance. He also uses his powers for transportation purposes, a primary example being his Gomu Gomu no Rocket, which has him grab something with his arms and fire himself like a slingshot, which helps him travel great distances quickly. Luffy has no problem letting other people play with his stretching body, which people tend to take advantage of. "}

Since the user is practically the only one who knows where their limbs will sprout out, they almost always have the element of surprise on their side, which, coupled with the fruit's long range and almost instantaneous speed of limb sprouting, turns Robin into a massive threat during combat situations. Enemies may find themselves in an extremely compromising position if they do not possess enough strength or an ability that lets them somehow counter or escape from her myriad of summoned limbs. \nAs Robin claimed to Pell, speed and strength mean nothing to her as she can render almost any foe into submission with ease, even those with superhuman speed such as Hakuba. Additionally, the fruit's powers are capable of affecting many opponents simultaneously, displaying great offensive capabilities through grappling or stomping techniques. For defense, Robin can conjure traps, shields or barriers to capture or repel incoming dangers with a multitude of her limbs. By sprouting eyes or ears in strategic places, the fruit's powers can also be used for gathering intelligence. The Hana Hana no Mi overall is incredibly versatile and permits multitasking for adventuring, battles or everyday activities. \nBefore the timeskip, Robin was capable of sprouting up to one hundred arms at once. At this apex of power, she could meld her arms together in order to create slightly larger ones, thereby allowing her to take on more powerful and larger foes. This fusion aspect is also not limited to bigger arms, as other creative and convenient constructs have also been displayed by Robin (even if briefly), such as a pair of wings to slow down a fall or a tree-like mass of limbs powerful enough to hold down even an ancient giant. \nAfter the timeskip, Robin's duplication ability has grown to the point of being able to sprout up to one thousand body parts at once, melding them into gigantic limbs. She has also developed the ability to create a full-body clone of herself. Unlike the rest of her abilities, her clone is also able to generate clothing, though this is an intentional discrepancy common to all Devil Fruits for obvious reasons. \nAccording to Oda, the user has a radius of 200 Hana Hanas in which they can extend parts of their body (although he did say this jokingly).

Gigantified body parts, despite their strength, also carry the inherent risk of providing an opponent a bigger target to strike against. \nThe capabilities of each replicated appendage is no different to that of Robin's actual corresponding limbs, meaning they reflect her own physical strength. This means that if a specific enemy is too heavy, Robin may have trouble holding them down. While Robin's gigantic limb constructs can remedy this to an extent, she will exhaust herself faster if she needs to create multiple instances of them. \nThe body parts are also bound to the surface they sprout from and cannot move from their spot. Moreover, the user cannot create limbs where there is not enough room. Environmental hazards likes fires are effective at limiting Robin's abilities too, as the flames will burn any surface potentially usable for the sprouting, as well as the sprouted limbs themselves. \nAnother weakness of Robin's Devil Fruit is that she needs to be able to see the object or what it looks like for her to effectively sprout her limbs on them. Therefore, she cannot attack, counter, or capture an enemy or object if she cannot see it within her range of view. This was seen well during the Jaya Arc, where Robin only managed to capture a South Bird located on the treetops once she had a clear view of it. \nOther than that, the user is also affected by the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses. As such, the numbing effects of seawater and seastone will also affect the user should their generated appendages touch them. "}

Her fighting style is mostly based on submission and grappling (and later wrestling), replicating her arms on specific points of her opponent's body to either immobilize, disarm or perform painful joint locks. When Robin activates her fruit's powers, she often takes a specific stance with her arms crossed in front of her body, almost as if she were concentrating. \nOutside of combat, the Hana Hana no Mi is plenty versatile, letting Robin multitask or help herself with some leisure activity. She may also employ her extra limbs for sillier applications, such as tickling or making comical imagery. \nRobin primarily uses the fruit's powers to replicate her arms, using them for a variety of purposes. The named techniques that Robin uses for her arms all follow a pattern. First, she says the number of arms she will sprout in Spanish followed by the word \"Fleur\", which means \"Flower\" in French. From there, depending on where she sprouted her arms, she can do a number of things. If the thing she will do next is an attack, she will state the name of the attack in English. An example of this pattern is the technique, Treinta Fleur: Strangle, wherein she sprouts thirty arms and then strangles her opponents. In the 4Kids dub, this pattern is different: she will instead state the whole technique in English and replace the \"Fleur\" with \"Floret\". In the VIZ manga and Funimation dub, the names of her techniques are the same as the original Japanese version. \nThe named techniques that involve her using the Devil Fruit to replicate and sprout her arms are as follows: \n \nThe following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story. \n \nConcludes non-canon section. \n \nThe following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story. \n \nConcludes non-canon section. \n \nThe following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story. \n \nConcludes non-canon section. \n \nThe following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story. \n \nConcludes non-canon section. \nAside from her arms, Robin can also replicate other parts of her body. These enable her to do a variety of things from giving her extra insight into other places with her eyes sprouting on certain objects, to transporting fallen comrades with her legs sprouting from out of their bodies. \nThe other body parts she can replicate usually include parts of her body that enable her to do things that her arms cannot do. These thus include Robin sprouting either eyes or ears to enable her to see or hear things that would otherwise be too inaccessible for her to get any closer. \nThe named techniques that involve her using the Devil Fruit to replicate and sprout other body parts aside from arms are as follows.

They can also become smaller than their original size, as even giants are shrunk down to being smaller than the average human. It would seem that Devil Fruit powers also become unusable, as Nico Robin was rendered helpless by her new form. In addition, toys are considered inorganic, being vulnerable to the likes of the Pamu Pamu no Mi, as well as suffering from deterioration caused by continuous strain to their bodies, leading to easier breakdown. However, if the victims were skilled fighters before becoming toys, that fighting knowledge is still retained. The user can take advantage of this by commanding toys who were skilled warriors in their true form to protect them. \nThe user can also control what form of toy that the victim will become. The user can also transform their victims into parts of even bigger toys in order to create powerful soldiers. \nA rather frightening aspect of the fruit's power is that once an individual becomes a toy, any and all memory of that person's existence will be erased. No matter how famous the victim was or how close they were to others, the victim will be completely forgotten by everyone. Toys are still able to remember their own identities, but they will not remember anyone else who has been turned into a toy as well. The memory erasure effect is instantaneous, as even spectators who witness the transformation first hand instantly forget the victims' existence, instead believing the toys suddenly appeared out of nowhere. This makes them much easier to enslave as there would be no-one to remember and thus attempt to rescue them. \nAnother effect of this fruit is that it halts the user's aging process upon consumption, effectively granting eternal youth. This effect seemingly applies to those turned into toys as well as they do not seem to change physically beyond the point of transformation. "}

Depending on the number of victims as well as their strength, the backfiring effect can be enormous since the state of being a toy and forgotten by others can fuel sentiments of rage and revenge on them. For this reason, Sugar was under constant protection by the Elite Officer, Trebol, and the purpose of Operation SOP was to exploit this in order to make the rebellion against the Donquixote Pirates easier to start. \nDespite the memory erasure being powerful, it does not affect physical evidence of those transformed such as an inscribed name or an engraved statue, and highly perceptive individuals can pinpoint that something is amiss, even if they cannot acknowledge what it is. Mukkashimi Tower was able to remember Kyros' fighting style when Ricky demonstrated it during Block B, but not the fighter himself, and Riku felt that there was a gap in his memories, having met and conversed with several Corrida Colosseum gladiators before they were eventually transformed and thus erased from his mind. \nWhile the user can control what sort of toy the victim will become, it appears that there is limit to how big each toy can be. Large individuals like Chinjao and even the giant, Hajrudin became quite small when turned into toys. If the user wishes to create much bigger toys than usual, then they'll have turn separate individuals into parts for them. \nAs the contract must be manually created immediately after the transformation, the toy can retain their own free will if they manage to escape Sugar before it is issued. Furthermore, it was hinted that the contract can only be made once per toy created, making subsequent contracts impossible. Also, despite being bound by the contract, the toys can circumvent it via loopholes, allowing them to act against certain conditions. Esta, for example, was pestered by a toy who managed to find a way around his contract, allowing him to express his human side and Milo could still reveal his true identity to others as long as he was directly asked about it by someone else. As a way to counter those, any loophole-abusing toy would be branded as \"defective\" and then discarded away into an underground scrap heap. If a toy was a skilled fighter while in their true form and had not been bound to a contract, they can prove to be quite troublesome for the user. \nOn top of that, the opponent will not transform unless the user touches them with their hand and their hand only. Also, the user has to deliberately make people they touch transform too. \nAnother possible weakness is since the aging process stops the moment the fruit is consumed, the user's age at the moment of consumption may be taken into consideration for the rest of their lives. The current user, Sugar, is consistently underestimated due to her little girl stature despite being an adult in terms of mental age. \nOther than all that, the user is also susceptible to the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses.

This allows the user to take control of anything made of stone that they come in contact with. While under the user's control, the stone gains a surprising level of flexibility and dexterity that it otherwise would not have, as seen by Pica's ability to stretch and reshape it in a surprising number of ways. In Pica's case, he can control the Dressrosa castle as if it were an extension of his own body, as it is entirely stone-made. \nIt also appears that the strength of this particular fruit is directly proportional to the amount of stone in the user's environment, and any damage done to the stone the user controls is not inflicted upon the user themselves, so long as their true body is not harmed. Because of this, at sufficient amounts, the user can withstand having pieces of their \"body\" destroyed to no end. \nWhile incredibly powerful and versatile, this fruit does have its weaknesses. The user needs to be merged with the stone in order to control it. In fact, the user's body does not actually transform into stone, but instead resides within it, and that portion is as vulnerable as any normal person. This was shown when Pica had to shift his conscious human part away to avoid Zoro's slash. \nAlso, if the user assimilates with stone and then loses contact with the ground (such as being sent into midair), the main body is unable to assimilate any stone from nearby environment. In that case, if the airborne stone containing the body is reduced into smaller pieces, the user has no choice but to emerge with his own body.

Apart from that, the strings can be imbued with Busoshoku Haki, increasing their strength and allowing them to bypass Devil Fruit-based defenses, such as Smoker's Moku Moku no Mi's intangibility. \nThe strings possess such enormous durability and tensile strength that extremely few things and people can cut, tear or otherwise damage them; not even multiple of Issho's meteorites coming crashing down one after the next damaged the strings that formed the bars of a Torikago in the slightest, not even burning them, instead being carved up; However, it is possible to overpower the bodily control of Parasite, as shown when Monkey D. Luffy managed to do so by activating Gear 4, causing the parasitic strings to snap off his body in a way that made it unclear if they took damage from that; in the anime, Luffy's various Gear 4 attacks were also potent enough to swiftly disperse the strings, such as those of Goshikito and even of Overheat. \nAt the same time, the strings' thinness makes it almost impossible to see them with the unaided eye, making it extremely difficult to avoid their path; most people who do not know of Doflamingo's power become completely unaware of how their bodies are moving against their will. The sharpness of the Ito Ito no Mi's strings is such that Doflamingo can cut through the flesh and bone of a giant as huge as Little Oars Jr., firearms, the back of Bobby Funk (even a Busoshoku Haki-infused Axe simply broke when swung against Bobby's back), and reinforced concrete with ease, all seemingly without being enhanced with Busoshoku Haki. \nAdditionally, like any Paramecia, the Ito Ito no Mi has the potential to be \"awakened\". If awoken, the fruit's power can allow the consumer to transmute the surrounding area, like the ground and buildings, into strings as well, which they can utilize for much stronger attacks and defense.

When faced with multiple opponents, he may use his string clones in addition to his puppets, using both against a single opponent to create a 2-vs.-1 situation or make them fight alongside him for combo potential. \nDoflamingo's main offensive capabilities lies in his use of the strings to cut his targets and destroy their weapons, to the point where he managed to cleanly sever Little Oars Jr.'s right leg in one swift motion and decapitate Crocodile, someone with immensely trained reflexes (though Crocodile might have not evaded on purpose due to his Logia powers, which protected him from harm). Later, Doflamingo was shown to be well capable of cutting a Logia type by brutally injuring Smoker with Goshikito by infusing his strings with Haki. When Issho brought down a meteorite on Green Bit, Doflamingo crossed his strings to form a net, slicing half of the rock into cubic pieces to protect himself. Additionally, he can compress the strings to create such constructs as a giant whip or even a clone of himself, capable of fighting alongside him, moving its mouth and transmitting his voice to appear to be talking and unraveling for Torikago, his ultimate technique. \nAside from offense and defense, Doflamingo can also use his strings to stitch together his internal organs if they are damaged, acting as a form of first aid. \nDoflamingo has completely mastered his powers of the Ito Ito no Mi and has thus managed to achieve the rare phenomenon of \"awakening\". This allows him to transform the ground and buildings around him into strings for him to use in for his attacks and defense, extending his range and attack volume. When utilizing awakening, Doflamingo tends to stay on the ground, shaping his strings into sharp, attacking tentacles and then unleashing them down on targets. Awakened strings can also be infused with Busoshoku Haki, granting Doflamingo extra offensive power. "}

This makes them particularly effective against the majority of weapons in the world: namely swords, guns, and cannons. By using repulsion, the user can deflect metal projectiles back to where they came from, turning them against the aggressor. Using attraction, the user can strip opponents of their weapons and bring them to their own body, rendering said opponents helpless. The user can also use attraction to pull themselves to large metal objects like ships, allowing them to travel through the air in a manner resembling flight. In general, the creatable magnetic forces are extremely strong and very difficult, if not impossible, to resist; by wrapping a metallic arm around Big Mom and repelling it, Kid was instantly able to send her flying up in the air, a noteworthy feat considering Big Mom's massive size and weight. \nThe fruit gives the user a sufficient degree of control over their magnetism to accumulate a large amount of metallic objects around their body and form them into specific shapes; the user can then move these masses around very fluidly, either by being directly connected to them or not. This has been seen repeatedly with Kid, who has accumulated metal objects on his body to form normally functioning apparatuses like mechanical arms, Gatling guns, railguns, and even exoskeletal fighting machines. Provided there is enough metal around, the users' creations can become very large in size quite easily and are, thus, capable of inflicting tremendous damage with simple crushing attacks. Even with massive apparatuses attached to his body, Kid has never shown himself to be physically burdened by them. Objects assembled with magnetism can maintain their structural integrity even after being separated from the user's body. Since the majority of these creations consist of random pieces of scrap metal held together purely by magnetism, attacks that damage these creations typically do little against the user, as they can just reform them with ease. \nAs with other Devil Fruits, this fruit's ability is capable of being \"awakened\". Once achieved, the user is capable of turning other objects, including living organisms, into magnets by assigning them with a specific polarity. This awakening has possible applications that do not rely on the user requiring metal from his surroundings, diminishing that specific weakness to an extent. "}

This power can also be applied on living beings, causing them to grow older in an instant. \nThe rate of decay will continue to progress once triggered, thus leading to potential problems after the initial purpose, such as a sinkhole becoming deeper until it reaches to the ocean. Also, if the user ages a living being, this will only apply physically, as the subject will retain their original mental maturity.

During the raid on Onigashima, Kid was forced to run around the island for quite some time in order to hoard enough metal pieces to utilize in the impending confrontation with Kaidou and Big Mom. However, no matter how much metal the user stockpiles, it seemingly will continue to stick to the user's body and get dragged around wherever they go, forming a gigantic, moving wall of scrap that may even engulf people in its way. \nAnother known weakness is that the magnetic forces holding larger metal constructs in place will weaken if the user himself receives significant damage.

Through repulsion, Kid repels metallic objects away from himself as a counter-offensive measure, such as reflecting a cannonball back towards its shooter. Through attraction, Kid draws in various metallic objects (often disarming his enemies in the process) and then assembles a mechanical contraption made from said objects. By far, Kid's most common application of the latter ability is to form gigantic, metallic arms connected to his actual ones, employing those in close-ranged combat. \nKid can shape random metallic objects into fully functional limbs, tools and weapons in a short amount of time and with no apparent difficulty, demonstrating a high degree of mastery over his Devil Fruit ability coupled with excellent engineering skills. Besides large mechanical arms, Kid can make enormous golems out of scrap metal that he can simultaneously ride and control with magnetism, form fully functional firearms for ranged combat or even build simple objects like boxes for imprisoning targets, giving the fruit support utility as well. \nDespite being dismembered by one of the Four Emperors, Kid easily adapted to his lost arm by successfully replacing it with a makeshift prosthetic arm created from his magnetic powers. In the event that Kid loses his prosthetic arm for whatever reason, he can just make another one on the spot with any metal items he manages to attract to himself. Kid can also repel his mechanical arm from his body as a surprise technique to catch enemies off guard. Additionally, having the prosthetic inadvertently gives Kid a small degree of immunity to the Wara Wara no Mi's damage transfer ability, since it is not his actual arm and renders any transferred damage to that body part void, a fact exploited by Killer in his fight with Basil Hawkins during the Raid on Onigashima. \nKid has mastered the fruit's ability to the point of awakening it, allowing him to manifest magnetic properties on targets. Should a target be affected by this with a significant amount of metal surrounding them, they will be quickly crushed by the metal, with the forces of attraction being strong enough to even rip large, established structures toward them. Kid can also cleverly stick a person to a piece of the environment by assigning both of those with inverse polarities, rendering the former immobilized and thus vulnerable for subsequent attacks. However, he is not used to his awakening yet and only uses it as a last resort due to the large amount of stamina it draws from him. "}

The size of the shadow itself does not have to be in proportion with the corpse's own in order to revive it, as is seen when Moria reanimated Oars' colossal corpse using Luffy's significantly smaller shadow. The minion that is created gains all the fighting techniques of the shadow's owner. The zombie will also adopt the shadow's personality quirks, though the zombie will eventually lose these quirks and become subservient to the Devil Fruit user. The zombie, however, is only as strong as the body it is composed of. \nDuring the Summit War of Marineford, Moria demonstrated that the Kage Kage no Mi is especially useful in war-like conditions, where there are plenty of soldiers to steal shadows from and ample dead bodies to use. The minion by itself also does not inherit any Devil Fruit powers of the original owner of the shadow. However, the Kage Kage no Mi user can manipulate the minion's shadow so that its body can simulate the body changing abilities, such as those of some Paramecia Devil Fruits. \nAs for the original owner of the shadow, they will enter a two day-long coma once their shadow is separated from them. The Devil Fruit user can use this side-effect to their advantage in battle, as the original owner is completely defenseless until they wake up from their coma or are woken up. The original owner of the shadow will be forced to remain in darkness, as they will vaporize if hit by sunlight without their shadow. Being unable to exist in light, the original owner is also unable to cast any sort of reflection and is also unable to be photographed. It is worth noting that while being exposed to daylight after having one's shadows extracted usually means instant death, victims who had their shadows extracted for some time can actually last a little more under the sun than those who have had their shadows taken very recently; during the final battle against Moria, the shadowless Straw Hat members instantly had their upper bodies disintegrated while the Rolling Pirates actually lasted a little longer. \nThe Devil Fruit user also has full control over whether or not the shadows return to their original owners; simply defeating the user, or even killing them, will not return the shadows they have stolen. The user must willfully say that a shadow should return to its master in order for it to be fully returned. However, this is contradicted by the fact that shadows can be returned to the owners by purifying or destroying the zombies being animated by them. \nThe user is also able to manifest their own shadow as a semi-liquid physical form. They are then able to control their shadow and make it fight for them in their stead. Their shadow, as a physical manifestation, is a being of strength similar to that of a Logia Devil Fruit user as their shadow, in that state, is impervious to damage. It is also able to change shape and size depending on the user's wishes. The user can also switch places with their shadow in order to get to different places. The moment when the user switches places with their shadow can also be used to dodge attacks, as the shadow is invulnerable to harm. \nThe most powerful aspect of the fruit is that the user can take the shadows they implanted into their zombie minions and place them into themselves for a power boost. This increase in power can be devastating if the user absorbs enough shadows and can ultimately cause the user to swell dramatically in size. "}

This technique will not cause the user's cheek any harm, and since only the user is capable of creating the dangos, they cannot be forcefully taken from their body against their will. \nThe dango's effect is similar to brainwashing, and though the consumer seems to retain all their memories and personality, they also gain an undying loyalty to the producer. They place the user's wellbeing and orders above all else, even their own lives. While the dangos usually are not capable of taming humans, those who have eaten functional SMILE fruits are an exception, being susceptible to being tamed due to their part-animal nature. Animals tamed with the dangos are considered \"servants\" (家来, kerai?) of the user, and people tamed by the ability expressly refer to the user as \"Master\" (ご主人様, Goshujin-sama?). \nThe effect of the dango lasts for one month and remains active even if the user loses consciousness.

Because such an ability was of major interest for the Beasts Pirates, Tama was ordered by Tenguyama Hitetsu to not use her Devil Fruit in the presence of others. However, Holed'em's subordinates did witness her doing so, leading to her capture. \nTama was initially not aware that she could tame Gifters from the Beasts Pirates, having learned about it with the help of Luffy. From that point on, Tama became an invaluable asset for the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance, as her Devil Fruit granted the rebel forces a means to convert the elite footsoldiers of the Beasts Pirates to their side, giving them a strategic advantage. For example, it was thanks to Tama that the Prisoner Mine's rebellion was covered up from Queen, as she tamed the prison warden, Babanuki, and had him lie about the status of the nearly 4000 prisoners that were freed. \nDue to their small, round shape, Usopp can use the dangos as ammo, which facilitated Tama's job in converting Gifters to her cause. In addition, because the Beasts Pirates remained unaware of the dango and its effects, Gifters under Tama's control, such as Speed, Gazelleman, and Daifugo, were capable of distributing them among their peers, tricking them into eating them by lying about their true nature.

{"id": 39, "url": "https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Kage_Kage_no_Mi", "category": {"category": "devil_fruits", "title": "Kage Kage no Mi"}, "text": "[Strengths and Weaknesses of Kage Kage no Mi]\n[Weaknesses]\nSince the user normally relies on shadows in order to be able to do anything with their powers, by depriving them of access to shadows, including their own, an opponent can disable the fruit's functionality entirely and render them completely powerless. This was demonstrated when Moria was attacked by Donquixote Doflamingo and was somehow separated from his shadow, thus leaving him defenseless. \nAnother weakness is that the user does not actually have to give the order for a shadow to be returned to the owner. If a zombie given a shadow from this fruit's power is fed salt, it will cause the shadow to return to its original owner, due to salt being an element of the sea (saltwater), which weakens Devil Fruit users. The amount of salt required to extract a shadow from the zombie is proportional to the zombie's size; most human-size zombies can be purified with a small pellet-sized amount, but a larger zombie such as Oars would require a large bag In particular, a fish-man, especially one who is skilled in manipulating sea water, can become a serious threat to the user. A shadow will also return to its original owner if the corpse housing the shadow is completely destroyed, as when Ryuma's body was set alight, Brook's shadow was restored. On top of this, Moria cannot simply kill his victims to prevent them from trying to get their shadows back later because their shadows will disappear if they die. In addition, when a shadow returns to its owner, the owner might gain memories of the zombie that their shadow was animating, such as when Lola recalled the friendship that her zombie had with Nami. \nAlso, the user can only fully control minions whose shadows come from owners who are relatively weaker than them. Minions with shadows that come from relatively strong owners are harder to control, as demonstrated when Inuppe, who contained Sanji's shadow, fought against the other zombies to protect Nami. Despite this, no matter how strong the shadow is, it will eventually forget its memories of its original owner and obey the user completely. However, the minions can still retain certain mannerisms of the shadow implanted into them even after becoming fully obedient, mostly detrimental ones that can limit their usefulness, such as Lola's attempts to get married, Ryuma's perverseness, John's drinking, Inuppe and Jigoro's constant bickering, and Oars's gullibility. Also, there are times when a zombie can become disobedient and even muster some of its former humanity from when it was alive, such as when Victoria Cindry could not move and was unable to follow Hogback's orders after Tony Tony Chopper's statement about humanity. The minions can also be too obedient for their own good; when Hogback was tricked into ordering Inuppe and Jigoro to jump out of a tall building, they complied without hesitation. There were also cases when a specifically given order would cause the created zombie to prioritize that order over their loyalty to Moria, as seen when Wild Zombies helped Perona defect from Thriller Bark after she instructed and told them of her plans to leave Moria. \nAnother notable weakness of the fruit is that the shadows that were freed by the user's powers can be used against them. After a zombie minion is purified, the shadow that is freed can be caught by anyone (since it is still temporarily in a tangible state until properly reunited with its original owner), who can place that shadow into themselves or into an ally. If the person is still conscious, they will gain the abilities of the shadow's original owner and become stronger. More than one shadow also can be placed into them, multiplying their strength by the number of shadows implanted. However, because the shadow that is implanted into a living person is not of the same soul, the shadow will only stay in their body for ten minutes. Afterwards, the shadow will return to its original owner. Also, the number of shadows that can be implanted into a person is somewhat limited by how strong the person's spirit is. If the person's spirit is weak, they will lose consciousness and the effects of the shadows will be wasted. For most regular people, two or three shadows is the limit, but strong-willed people can hold more than that and even be transformed into a much stronger form, depending on how many shadows they take in. Monkey D. Luffy, in particular, was able to hold one hundred shadows in his body, making himself even stronger than Oars. While Moria himself was able to contain 1,000 shadows, it caused a notable strain on him that not only slowed him down, but the shadows kept leaking out whenever he was struck, returning to their owners even without his orders. Additionally, the user appears to have no way of keeping track of the shadows that they extract from their victims; when Luffy, in Nightmare mode, came out to confront Moria, the Warlord of the Sea actually thought that Luffy's new form was a result of shape-shifting powers, not realizing his part that led to Luffy becoming that strong until much later. \nAlso, if the user is using other shadows to empower themselves, then hitting them with enough force or pressure can cause the shadows to escape through the mouth and back to the original owners. This was demonstrated when Moria was crushed underneath his own mansion and when he was hit with Luffy's Gomu Gomu no Gigant Jet Shell or Jinbe's Samegawa Seiken. The user can partially prevent this by covering their mouths with their hands, but this is only a temporary solution. \nBecause the power heavily relies on the power of others, this can cause the user to weaken over time because they rely too much on their subordinates to fight, making the user lazy; Moria claimed that he would become the Pirate King simply through the use of his zombie army, and the high-ranking World Government member(s) later decided that he was too weak to continue being a Warlord of the Sea and sent Doflamingo to eliminate him. \nAlso, while Doppelman automatically protects the user from attacks, it can be tricked and cannot react to an ambush or surprise attack. Other than that, the user is affected by the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses. "}

With the help of Hogback's surgical ability to create all sorts of creatures, and a large freezer filled with tons of corpses, Moria has been able to create a large army of the dead. \nMoria can also use his powers in battle in a manner suiting his personal motto by manifesting his shadow into a dark, semi-liquid silhouette figure resembling himself. This being is impervious to conventional attacks and can split itself into smaller bat-like shapes. Generally, Moria mostly uses his shadow to both attack enemies and protect himself without personally doing anything. \nMoria can also switch places with his own shadow in order to travel long distances or escape from enemy attacks. Since his zombie minions do not inherit Devil Fruit abilities from the shadows animating them, Moria can also aid his zombie minions in the execution of some of their techniques by implanting his shadow into theirs. \nMoria's greatest ability, however, revolves around empowering himself with the shadows he uses to animate his zombie minions, absorbing both power and skill, by assimilating them into his own body. A person that had a shadow infused into them would also experience similar effects (an initial side-effect is an area around their eyes darkening in color), and the more shadows they absorb, the more power they amass; however, the number of shadows that they can take in at any given time all depends on their willpower.

At full weight, the user can severely injure even animals as large as dinosaurs. \nEven with one's weight increased, it seems as though the user of the fruit can move normally, their movement being unaffected by their weight. They also do not seem to be particularly affected by the collisions they make with the ground, sustaining minimal damage from their descent. Meanwhile, with their weight decreased, the user can dodge enemy attacks from the ground with rather ease, simply needing to float away from the attack's range. \nThough the fruit grants the ability to change one's own weight, it does not seem to change the user's density or physical resistance against outside forces, since Mikita was knocked away by Nami and Vivi while weighing 10,000 kilograms before she could crash down on Usopp. In cases where the user attempts to drop down with extreme weight from a considerable altitude, a fast enough opponent can simply dodge the attack while the user crashes into the ground.  \nThe Kiro Kiro no Mi is considered inferior to the Ton Ton no Mi, as the latter can make themselves much heavier than this fruit's maximum weight.

With Luffy's strong spirit, he managed to contain one hundred shadows within him when most normal people could only contain two or three. In this form, Luffy was several times bigger than his normal self, and his skin turned completely blue. He was roughly the same size as Moria, and his body was similar to Chopper in Heavy Point. Luffy also talked differently, losing his usual carefree tone and instead speaking with a grim seriousness. \nAs Luffy possesses the Gomu Gomu no Mi, he is rubber and can stretch his fists to increase his range and attack momentum. Being further augmented by the 100 shadows, all of his normal techniques are further increased in power, enough to topple even Oars. \nWhile in this form, Luffy could use the combined strength and skills of the shadows within him. With this strength, Luffy stopped a giant Gomu Gomu no Rifle attack delivered by Oars with one hand and unleashed massive attacks onto the zombie behemoth. He could also move at incredible speeds, having safely rescued Nami and Usopp from a rampaging Oars, which was only made clear when Luffy made his presence known. Because one of the shadows belonged to a swordsman, Luffy also gained the ability to fight with swords, something he never knew before. \nHowever, this form only lasted for ten minutes; after that, all of the shadows within Luffy returned to their original owners. \nEarly jokes of Nightmare Luffy were revealed in One Piece Green: Secret Pieces.

The game also made more elaboration on the skills he demonstrated in the manga and anime, such as using a nodachi by jumping up and slashing downwards at his opponents, and his high-speed movements are similar to Soru.

Bentham has perfect recollection of every person whose form he has ever copied, so he will not forget any person whom he imitates. The user can revert back to their own body by touching their face with their left hand. \nThe greatest strength of this fruit lies more in its immense potential for deception and creating confusion. By copying the appearance of an important individual, such as royalty, the user can use their position and authority as if it was their own. The user can likewise ruin a person's reputation by framing them for crimes they didn't commit by appearing as them and confessing it was their doing. In both these case, the user needs to make sure the real person hidden away first so no one realizes the truth. The user can also make someone lower their guard by copying someone important to them, such as a friend or family member. Overall, while the fruit lacks much offense purposes, it can potentially topple countries given time and proper planning, as it two known users have demonstrated. "}

Apparently, the user can manifest several features belonging to different people at the same time, though this mostly comes off as comical and affords no strategical battle advantage whatsoever, making this fruit usable only for purposes such as stealth, infiltration, and subterfuge. As copied abilities must be gained through touch, some stronger opponents are hard to get close to and may keep the user at bay.   \nThe user also cannot copy their user's clothes, mannerisms or weapons, so their ability to deceive others depends greatly on their acting abilities. Any key weapons or items possessed by the person will need to be obtained through other means, such as through stealing. Devil Fruit powers also cannot be copied, unless it is the some form of a Zoan fruit. For instance, Bentham was able to mimic Chopper's Brain Point form, which had been granted to him through the Hito Hito no Mi.   \nFurthermore, while the fruit allows the user to flawlessly copy the physique of a chosen individual, it does not allow them to imitate or adapt to the skills or fighting abilities of the person being impersonated. Similarly, the user may also not be able to use their own techniques depending on whose body they imitate; Bentham is unable to use his Okama Kenpo while in Nami's form because her body is not physically conditioned for it, so he has to change back whenever he starts performing a move. \nLastly, the user's impersonation abilities can be counteracted using measures to identify them. For example, the Straw Hats each wrapped their arm with a bandage as a distraction from the X mark underneath it to identify the real Straw Hats, whereas Bentham would not have this item if he were to impersonate any one of them. \nIt also seems that if the user is struck while in disguise, they will revert back to their original form, as evidenced by Bentham changing back after being punched by Nami and then later kicked by Sanji in two different occasions. Likewise, a clever enough opponent can trick the user into simply touching their own face with their left hand to undo the disguise. "}

Even if the targets move away from their current locations, the thrown objects will pursue them, immediately changing their trajectory in order to chase their targets. Furthermore, as shown with Noah, the user does not even need to actually throw the object for it to fly towards the target. All Decken had to do was touch the giant ship with a memorized hand and the ship itself rose off the sea bed without any assistance, aimed towards Shirahoshi. Outside of combat, the power can serve as a sort of homing device to find the target's location. Vander Decken IX used this idea to find Shirahoshi when he realized she was not in the tower. He threw a large piece of coral and then jumped on it, riding it to Shirahoshi's location. "}

Even a person as strong as Luffy stated that the force behind the axe Decken threw was quite powerful. Also, if the target the user has chosen happens to be anywhere near them, the thrown projectile will actually even swerve back in a manner not unlike to a boomerang coming back to its thrower. Furthermore, while the user is affected by the sea water, the objects used to target the recipient(s) can still travel underwater, without the sea affecting or decreasing the intended function.

Despite this, the thrown object is not guaranteed to hit even particularly fatally; even at point blank range, a knife thrown at Shirahoshi only hit her in the shoulder. Also, despite the incredible force of the thrown projectiles, they can still be blocked by obstacles or people of sufficient strength, in which the effect of the fruit will be nullified, and the item reverts back to being stationary. It will not always act completely like a homing device, and as admitted by Decken himself, there are ways to protect one's self from his power. This is shown when an axe Decken threw stopped following its target, in this case Princess Shirahoshi, after Luffy blocked it. Hody has taken advantage of the fire-and-forget concept of his projectiles and used Decken himself to block the path of a thrown axe. \nIn order to keep being able to target a certain person, the user must keep the hand that touched them from physically touching anyone else. Reasonably, owing to the fact that Decken must \"mark\" the target by touching them with his hands, he can be heavily disadvantaged in long-range combat against someone whom he had never marked before. The user can only mark living creatures, and when a target dies, the ability of throwing is removed, which was how Decken became aware that Shirahoshi was still alive in spite of the repetitive projectiles that he kept sending at her, all of which were successfully deflected by Luffy. Also, should the user die or fall unconscious while an object is following its target, the effect will be cancelled, as shown when Decken fell unconscious and Noah stopped chasing Shirahoshi, sinking back to Fish-Man Island. \nOther than all that, the user is still affected by the standard Devil Fruit weakness, as shown when Decken has to coat his ship and leave his ship in a Flutter Kick Coating, despite being a fish-man.

Petrification can also be achieved through physically striking an opponent, although the only area that is turned to stone is the contacted area, as opposed to the entire body.

Apparently, once the petrification takes effect, victims will experience a state of suspended animation where, from their point of view, it is as though time has stopped, up until Hancock may choose to undo the petrification. According to Hancock, killing the current user of the Mero Mero no Mi's power does not undo any petrifications they have induced beforehand, and a new eater of the Mero Mero no Mi will be unable to reverse a previous ability user's petrifications (as they were induced by the previous user's innate qualities), leaving the effect completely irreversible.

When coated with Busoshoku Haki, the mochi becomes an effective blunt-force weapon and is capable of trapping people, even extremely strong ones, due to its sticky, stretchy nature. The latter is such that high-caliber gunfire is completely unable to pierce through it. Additionally, due to its high malleability, hardenability, and compatibility with Haki, the mochi can be formed into a wide variety of shapes, such as replicas of body parts (like fists or feet to strike with, which may be formed from the user's body), large tendrils or even spiked clubs, as well as walls and other, even more elaborate structures. \nUnique amongst the Paramecia class, this fruit's ability to transform the user into mochi is analogous to the properties of a Logia fruit. Thus, the user is invincible against attacks that are not imbued with Busoshoku Haki, as any part of their body that is struck by an attack simply morphs into mochi that can reform after. \nAs with all Devil Fruits, this one has the potential to be \"awakened\", which allows the user to turn inorganic material around them into mochi.

He has been shown extending his limbs using mochi for various tasks. He can extend his leg to form an extremely fast, large, tendril-like blunt weapon, imbuing it with Haki to harm the rubber-bodied Monkey D. Luffy, and at the same time, entrap him. This extension of limbs is also helpful in situations where Katakuri has to rescue or secure others from danger. \nKatakuri has used his Devil Fruit to create mochi earplugs in order to resist his mother's destructive scream, creating and distributing more of them to his siblings as well. The mochi can also be used to plug up cannons, causing them to explode when fired. \nThis Devil Fruit is similar to the Gomu Gomu no Mi, as it gives the user's body the properties of a \"stretchy\" substance that allows them to extend their limbs and expand their bodies at will. This similarity was noted by Carrot and Katakuri himself. However, unlike the rubber powers gained from the Gomu Gomu no Mi, the user can also fully transform their body into their substance (in this case, mochi) and even produce it outside of their body and manipulate it. This allows Katakuri to imitate a few of Luffy's own techniques, such as Gomu Gomu no Hawk Gatling and Gomu Gomu no Elephant Gun, with his ability to manipulate mochi making him further capable of adding twists of his own, such as extra mochi arms for his version of Gomu Gomu no Hawk Gatling. Due to Katakuri's physical abilities, these replicated techniques end up being more effective than Luffy's own attacks. \nBecause of Katakuri's highly advanced Kenbunshoku Haki, he is able to change the shape of his mochi body to dodge attacks, causing Haki-imbued attacks to pass through air rather than hit him. He is able to transform into mochi to block off bullets and reform after suffering lethal injuries like bisection. However, he must remain calm to use his Kenbunshoku Haki effectively to predict where the opponent will strike and shift his body accordingly, or else he is susceptible to Haki like any Devil Fruit user. \nAs an awakened Devil Fruit user, Katakuri can turn surrounding inorganic material into mochi, spreading the adhesive substance around to enhance his range of attacks and to capture his opponents.

These bubbles can be stored and accessed by everybody touching it, causing the touching person to feel whatever emotion was stored inside the bubble.

These attacks are so powerful that they can leave paw-shaped imprints in rock. \nOne misconception about the powers of the Nikyu Nikyu no Mi is that it gives its user the ability to teleport at will. However, this assumption is incorrect. Rather than teleport, Kuma uses the incredible speed of his Devil Fruit power to propel himself, other people, or objects across certain distances. This method of propulsion, however, is limited to an extent. Landmarks can get in the way of the propelling's trajectory, forcefully stopping the sent object from reaching its proper destination. As an example, its power was unable to break past the Red Line, leading Kuma to crash into it at high speeds and suffer heavy damage while simultaneously forcing him to climb up the continent to its summit in order to resume his voyage. \nWhile the user is able to deflect attacks, they can only do so by using their bare hands. If the user's hands are otherwise occupied, being caught off guard for instance, they will receive damage from an attack that could have been otherwise averted.

Examples of the ways wherein the user can \"surgically\" manipulate things in their ROOM are: swapping the locations of two targets to teleport them, levitating and moving objects of any size around akin to telekinesis, \"scanning\" targets, slicing people/objects apart without actual injury and then reattaching the separate parts to other surfaces, transplanting \"personalities\" (spirits), permanently taking out people's organs without harm, creating electric shocks or energetic constructs to destroy people's bodies from the inside, etc. As long as the user's chosen targets are inside their ROOM, they are within range and the user's techniques instantly reach them regardless of distance. \nMore specifically, inside ROOM and with the use of a blade, the user can perform long-ranged spatial slicing to cleanly sever flesh and bone without actually hurting the victim. People separated by this ability are not killed and can still feel their separated parts, regardless of the distance (much like Buggy when he separates himself using the Bara Bara no Mi). Internal organs removed by this ability will become vulnerable and unprotected. The effects of this application of the Ope Ope no Mi persist even after the ROOM is disengaged. Separated parts can be reassembled back to normal or be mixed-up and attached in any manner the user sees fit, such as sticking someone's severed head onto other surfaces, including inanimate objects, or onto someone or something else's body. However, even if a victim gets reassembled back to normal, the possibility of said body parts splitting up once more with the appropriate injury still exists. This happened with Kin'emon during the war against the Beasts Pirates (after Kaidou pierced him with a sword in the spot his legs were first split by Law), a long time after his reassembling back in the Punk Hazard Arc. Apparently, victims with Devil Fruit powers still retain their abilities after being cut into pieces, but only parts with \"conscience\" (i.e. the head) seem to be able to access them while in this state. Devil Fruit users who have been split by this power will still feel the effects of seawater if one of their body parts has been submerged. When the cutting power is used on a non-living object, the effect will result as if it were a normal cut. \nAnother major ability granted by this fruit is the manipulation of spatial positions, which is done akin to a form of mutual teleportation. This technique is especially useful in rain or snowstorms, since there are several droplets of water or snow in the air that can allow the user to place anything almost anywhere, whenever they want to. Moreover, it is possible to even swap abstract concepts such as one's \"soul\", much like how Bartholomew Kuma is capable of removing one's \"pain\" with his Nikyu Nikyu no Mi. After switching people's souls, only the user himself can reverse it, but the recipients' bodies must be present in order for him to restore them back to their original bodies. In the case of switched \"souls\", Devil Fruit powers are maintained within the original physical body, while voices and other abilities, such as Haki, go along with the switched souls, due to Haki originating from the individual's spirit, not their body. This was demonstrated when Sanji used his Kenbunshoku Haki in Nami's body. \nWhile the ability to freely manipulate people, objects and even abstract concepts within a defined space is the fruit's signature power, it is far from being its only one. Just like with ROOM, the user is capable of manifesting other energy-based constructs that work for a variety of purposes and grant massive versatility in combat. From its vast power over space, the user can release spatial energy in the form of high-voltage shocks that act like defibrillators or form electric blades that can bypass physical flesh, directly destroying internal organs. Another similar technique involves the creation of a scanning light encompassing the entire ROOM with the intent of locating specific objects inside it. For defense, the user can manifest transparent veils to protect themselves from incoming enemy attacks. \nIt is worth noting that the effects caused by this Devil Fruit's operations persist even if the user is rendered unconscious or restrained with Seastone, such as Nami and Sanji's minds remaining swapped or Law, Smoker, and Monet still living with their hearts removed from their bodies when the user found himself in such conditions. Also, it has been shown to be possible to use this ability in conjunction with Busoshoku Haki, as seen when Law was able to bypass Smoker's Logia defenses through his Mes technique. \nIn addition to its many combat applications, this Devil Fruit's spatial abilities can also be applied for medical purposes. The Ope Ope no Mi has been described as having \"miraculous\" properties, having the ability to cure any kind of illness, but at the same time still requires some extent of medical knowledge in order to be utilized effectively, as the fruit's influence only bends but not fully defy biological aspects of those recipient to its life-saving applications and its miraculous healing is actually focused on spatially extracting disease-causing impurities such as bacteria and viruses directly out of the patients' bodies. As such, if a doctor of prodigious medical expertise were to obtain this fruit's power, their medical abilities would be second to none. Being an exceptionally skilled and knowledgeable surgeon and doctor, Law can use this ability to its full potential. He has demonstrated the medical prowess of this fruit by curing himself of Amber Lead Syndrome as a child and again when he cured the giant children at Punk Hazard from their drug addiction and poisoning. \nThe greatest power of this fruit, which has earned its reputation of being the \"Ultimate Devil Fruit\", is the ability to grant another person eternal youth via the \"Perennial Youth Operation\" (不老手術, Furō Shujutsu?, \"Perpetual Youth Surgery\" in the Funimation adaptations, and \"Immortality Operation\" in the VIZ manga) though performing this feat comes at the cost of the current fruit user's life. Doflamingo sought out this fruit in order to trick Law into performing it on him so he could conquer the world and possibly rule over it forever. According to Doflamingo, the World Nobles possess a national treasure that, if used in combination with the Ope Ope no Mi, would allow the user to effectively conquer the entire world. \nOnce this fruit is \"awakened\", the user gains the ability to create special ROOMs that adhere directly to foreign objects or living beings instead of surrounding a specific space around the user, not requiring their presence within the operating field for techniques to be performed (unlike normal ROOMs, where the user needs to be inside at all times). This directly addresses one of the fruit's biggest weaknesses, which is the stationary nature of its normal field of range. "}

So far, no character has been shown escaping those cuffs, so it is unknown if it is possible to break them away. \nWhen the user makes contact with something they intend to bind, their body will bend in an unnatural manner and transform into something akin to a giant, restraining metal cuff around the spot contact was made (with the bending body part fully regenerating afterwards). It is also possible for the user to shackle more than one object at once, allowing them to secure a target to the nearby environment. \nThe user also has the ability to generate flexible metal bars that behave much like their body does, bending around and restraining anything in their way. This method grants more range to the user and can encircle their immediate surroundings in order to capture multiple people at once. "}

It should be noted that when a user creates ROOM, it remains stationary until dismissed and another one is created, indicating that the user may not be able to move the ROOM once it is established and that summoning multiple ROOMS at once is impossible. While a big enough ROOM tends to be hard to notice, smaller ones can be easily detected, allowing an enemy to spot it and keep their distance. \nWhile the fruit provides access to a multitude of abilities, most of them have limitations of their own. For example, the user is required to complete hand gestures in order to use certain attacks, with Doflamingo being shown at least once blocking Law's \"Mes\" technique by restraining his arm. Moreover, for the user to swap something or themselves into a specific position inside his ROOM, they need to somehow set up the positioning of the destination object in case there is nothing already present beforehand. In addition, while the user can telekinetically lift anything or anyone else within the ROOM, they apparently cannot lift their own bodies. \nA major weakness of this fruit is that usage of the fruit's abilities depletes the user's stamina. This results in situations where the user must rest after or avoid long or multiple enemy confrontations in order to use his powers further down the line. Over-usage and exerting to the range limit can even result in shortening of the lifespan, especially when making use of the fruit's awakened abilities as they likely consume more stamina than usual. The usage of the Perennial Youth Operation, in particular, will cost the user his or her own life. \nIt was also hinted by Smoker that a Logia's intangibility may offer some level of protection from the fruit's powers. However, if a Logia user has a part of them severed by this power (when used in conjunction with Busoshoku Haki), then that part of them loses the effects of the user's Devil Fruit; this means that such parts can be harmed without the Logia fruit protecting it from damage. In addition, Smoker also strongly insinuated that sufficient proficiency with Haki may offer some level of resistance to the fruit's effects. In support of Smoker's claims, Law was unable to cut through Doflamingo's usage of Busoshoku Haki, with the latter catching the former's sword and stopping Law's attack despite being inside of Law's ROOM. Haki being used as a deterrent to this fruit's effects was further proven in the Wano Country Arc, where Law confirmed he was unable to displace either Big Mom or Kaidou around due to their far superior Haki. \nIn regards to the fruit's medical applications, a good deal of medical knowledge is required to use the Ope Ope no Mi to its fullest extent. Also, as Donquixote Rosinante pointed out, the fruit's miraculous applications and premises are not divine or in any way omnipotent by nature, and still follows the core rules of science and medical logic, albeit somewhat conditionally. As such, the user must be intellectual enough on how to utilize its powers when circumventing, however slightly, those rules for the advantage (or at least preservation) of recipients to be modified by the fruit's power, in order for him or her to employ the Ope Ope to its utmost medical potential.  \nOther than that, the user is affected by the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses.

Water Law]\nLaw is overall a tricky and smart fighter, using his various abilities to redirect attacks coming at him, disarm opponents or escape perilous situations, among a diversity of other tactics. From its first appearance, Law developed this ability to a great extent over the timeskip as his ROOM now covers a much larger area than it did before. \nIt was stated by Smoker that the spherical territory generated by Law marks the range of how long Law can affect targets from afar. He generally uses the warping aspect of this power to his advantage. Both in and out of battle, he uses this ability to help him obtain things that are otherwise beyond his physical reach or to confuse an opponent. The Ope Ope no Mi makes Law well-suited at fighting long-range battles, since he practically wields full control of an area where anything can happen for as long as his powers are active. However, he is just as formidable in close-range combat, having defeated Vice Admiral Smoker in this manner and later one of the Yeti Cool Brothers using an offensive contact technique. \nLaw typically uses his Devil Fruit powers in tandem with his swordsmanship, making his sword a \"scalpel\" of sorts while his powers are active. A swing from Law's sword is usually enough to bisect a whole squadron of enemies from afar. Another common form of attacking includes Law telekinetically launching debris at his foes, slashing the surrounding environment into pieces in case he needs more \"ammo\". \nHe can also use the fruit's powers to aid him in his medical operations, such as by cutting his patients into pieces so as to methodically remove hazardous objects or substances from their bodies, and rejoining them together. It was by using this ability that he managed to remove the Amber Lead that accumulated within his own body, thus saving himself from the otherwise incurable lead poisoning, and is the primary reason why he was force fed the fruit in the first place. Law used this power to turn the people on Punk Hazard, who lost the use of their legs due to a chemical-weapon explosion on the island, into centaurs and satyrs by attaching their upper bodies to the lower bodies of their respective animals. \nThe fruit can be used to grant another person eternal youth in exchange for the current user's life, something Doflamingo originally tried to brainwash Law into doing upon discovering that the child ate the fruit. However, Law states that he has no interest in this particular ability, least of all for his enemy. \nHaving achieved awakening of his ability, Law is capable of creating \"remote\" ROOMs that function differently from normal ones. Those awakened ROOMs can be tossed at or coated on objects to spatially distort them in a variety of ways, with Law not needing to be inside their range in order to do so. Law primarily utilizes his awakening in conjunction with his sword, allowing him to increase its size and/or make it phase through targets, similar to how regular, spherical ROOMs work. When his awakening is applied on enemy targets, Law becomes able to operate on them from afar, be it through his usual moves or more abstract effects like noise cancelling. Through this application, Law has developed at least one technique in homage to Donquixote Rosinante, his childhood savior. That said, Law claims that he is not yet used to this ability and its huge consumption of stamina, hence him relegating it to a last resort move should his regular techniques fail him. "}

This doctor became a legend, as the Ope Ope no Mi allowed him to perform miraculous operations that cured all kinds of diseases. \nEmporio Ivankov speculated that a past user of this fruit had performed the \"Perennial Youth Operation\" on someone, explaining how this ability was known in the present. \nWhen Donquixote Doflamingo escaped Mary Geoise, he took with him the knowledge of the Holy Land's national treasure, which would allow him to conquer the entire world if he were to combine it with the Ope Ope no Mi's ability to grant him eternal life. For this reason, he sought out this Devil Fruit. \nAbout six months after his brother, Donquixote Rosinante, left the crew with Law to search for a cure for Amber Lead Syndrome, Doflamingo got news of the Ope Ope no Mi being sold to the Marines by a pirate who did not know of the fruit's true potential, and contacted Rosinante to inform him of this. Doflamingo ordered the two runaways to return to the crew, and once the crew stole this fruit from the transaction, Rosinante was to eat the fruit and use its powers to heal Law. What Doflamingo did not inform his younger brother, however, was that he intended to order Rosinante to use the Perennial Youth Operation on him, granting Doflamingo eternal life. Rosinante had already figured out Doflamingo's unspoken intention, and being a spy for the Marines who already possessed a Devil Fruit power, decided to circumvent this transaction himself, so he could feed the fruit to Law and save him from the Amber Lead Syndrome. Eventually, Rosinante succeeded in stealing the Ope Ope no Mi and was en route to Law when his clumsiness caused him to tumble off a cliff. He was then subsequently ambushed by the pirates from whom he stole the fruit. "}

Regardless, Doflamingo recomposed himself and decided to shift his plan, planning to \"educate\" Law into seeing the importance of dying for him, unaware that Law heard this heartless comment while hidden. Law, on the other hand, plotted to use this power, amongst everything else he has, to defeat Doflamingo and avenge Rosinante. \nEver since Law betrayed the crew, the Donquixote Pirates have been desperate to retrieve the power in order to grant Doflamingo eternal youth while acknowledging that Law would not perform the operation onto Doflamingo.

Even cannonfire from a Marine battleship is not sufficient to hurt or even delay the user when they are merged with a large enough island. \nThe user can further manipulate the landmarks they are assimilated with to perform actions such as emoting or talking (by creating a fissure on a surface to act as a mouth, for example).

The user can hold even living people inside their body, by shrinking their sizes as long as they are within the vicinity of the user. When the objects and people within the user get out they return to their normal size. This can be done by exiting a certain distance away from the body, shown by a pinkish layer of an unknown aura centered on the user's location, or through a unique alternative route like the Mirro-World. Once someone enters this aura they automatically get sucked into the castle. When the user grows to unleash the fortress' full size, the shrinking affect is nulled. In addition, the user's castle defenses can be deployed in a circular formation to give them a full 360 degrees of protection and attack coverage, as well as the potential to conduct decisive surprise ambushes. \nAs long as the user does not manifest castle features on their external body, the castle features of their internal body will remain concealed and unnoticeable. This has the advantage of lulling others into a false sense of security who think they are facing a single individual in combat who appears to be lacking armaments on the surface, only for the fruit's user to reveal the militia and weaponry hidden within. If the user does not wish to engage in combat personally, they can shield themselves by releasing their subordinates and let them do the fighting for them. The user can also use their body as a storage facility for recreational purposes, as they are shown to house food and drink for subordinates and any outsiders. The user has complete control over the fortress in their body, and can telekinetically move around and create objects from inside as they see fit. However, movement from the outside does not seem to affect the inside. \nThe user also has the ability to make a miniature version of themselves through a strange fluid as a way to communicate with those inside; however, the user can still just talk from outside their body in order to be heard. They are capable of being alert and moving around in the real world while also being in their own body. Should any damage occur to the outside body, the miniature version will reflect said damage on itself, feeling pain and showing visible injuries on their equivalent spot of the damaged area. \nAdditionally, the user can also turn their body into an actual fortress, resembling a humanoid golem; while they still retain a humanoid form, they will grow significantly in size as their skin becomes stone and the rooms in the castle become life-sized. The fortress has immense defensive power, being immune to cannon fire and even withstand a ruthless beating from the Emperor Big Mom (at least for a while), making it a suitable safe haven in the midst of a battlefield.

The manifested souls take the form of a light-pink, spectral-looking but (for the user) tangible substance, which leaks out of the victim's body like smoke. The user can extract the victim's soul by grabbing it once it is surrounding the target's body and pulling it out. This effectively steals from the victim's very lifespan, the amount of which is determined by the user: it is possible to steal decades of a person's life at once should they desire, or mere seconds. The user can steal part of the victim's lifespan, leaving their remaining lifespan that much shorter, or even take enough years to steal a victim's entire remaining lifespan, killing them instantly. \nBy infusing objects with soul fragments, the user can \"humanize\" them. Recipients (which are referred to as \"homies\") gain human-like intelligence, as well as the ability to speak. Almost anything can be made into a homie, including plants, minerals, food, clothing, furniture, air, light, and even living animals. Inanimate objects are brought to life and gain the ability to stand upright and move independently, their most notable feature being that they have a human face. Some of them can gain special abilities, such as a carpet homie becoming a flying carpet. Animal homies become more human-like, not only gaining the ability to talk and walk upright, but also fighting and using weapons. According to Big Mom, the more powerful the individual the soul was taken from, the more powerful the resulting homie will be. Additionally, homies will be more powerful if they possess a larger quantity of soul fragments within them, and can eat other homies to absorb their soul and become stronger. \nThe user can even infuse souls into substances produced by other Devil Fruits. For example, Big Mom can give life and autonomy to Cracker's Biscuit Soldier puppets and Perospero's candy constructs. In certain cases, this also allows Big Mom to exert control over another person's Devil Fruit substance. For example, by creating a homie from a mound of Perospero's candy, she is able to control the movement of the candy much like Perospero himself. \nHomies are subservient to the user, as they fear and respect their powerful soul, allowing them to easily create more and more subordinates with every soul taken. Since a Vivre Card is naturally infused with the owner’s soul, a Vivre Card created from the user of the Soru Soru no Mi will allow the person wielding it to command the homies just as if they were the fruit's user themselves. However, the user's presence and commands supersede those of the person with the user's Vivre Card. The card itself exudes a bright-pink aura that only homies can see, and seems to frighten them. Even if a homie does muster the nerve to turn against and attack the user, they are typically powerless to do much as the user can rip out the soul inside them with ease. \nThe user can also use fragments of their own personal soul to create \"special homies\", who tend to be more powerful than regular ones. It is currently unknown how using one's own soul to create special homies might affect the user's own life expectancy. The user may also manifest their own soul in the form of roughly human-sized, dark, somewhat humanoid blobs (known as \"Incarnations\"), which possess limited sentience and can take people's souls as well. \nWhile souls cannot be infused into living beings, the user themself appears to be an exception to a certain extent. It is possible for one to sacrifice a portion of their own lifespan in exchange for extra power and size, with the amount of strength gained being dependent on the strength of the soul. In addition, the user can turn their individual body parts into Homies themselves, allowing said parts to act independently of the user's own normal bodily functions. Big Mom, for example, can give life to her own skeleton and order it to restructure itself in case of broken bones, thus providing a unique form of self-healing. "}

One limitation is that the user also has to be in close proximity to the target in order to be able to take away their lifespan, as they need to physically grab and pull the soul out to extract it from their body. \nThe most prominent limitation is that in order for the soul to be extracted, the target needs to be afraid of the user, even if just a little. Individuals who do not feel any fear of the user are completely immune to soul extraction. Big Mom is able to avoid this weakness most of the time thanks to her infamous reputation, imposing appearance and incredible power. However, strong-willed individuals such as Jinbe, Trafalgar Law and Eustass Kid were all immune to her ability due to their lack of fears and absolute refusal to be afraid of her. \nWhile soul fragments can be infused into animals, plants and lifeless objects, they cannot be infused into other people or corpses. However, it appears that a person's own soul can be returned to them after being extracted, circumventing this limitation, which restores an amount of lifespan equal to how much of their soul was returned; even lifeless bodies can be revived this way. This was shown with Charlotte Moscato, who was seemingly killed by his mother after having all his remaining lifespan taken away during her rampage on Sweet City, but was later seen alive on the Queen Mama Chanter. But it seems that only entities capable of physically interacting with souls (such as the fruit's user, or their Incarnations) can perform this process, as Mont-d'Or was seen ordering two Incarnations to gather \"every last second\" of Moscato's lifespan they could find, indicating that he was unable to do it himself. \nHomies are fully alive beings, and are thus susceptible to physical pain and fear. They can be injured and even killed with a lethal enough attack, with their faces being suggested to be their most vulnerable spots. Prime examples include Kingbaum, who was severely injured after being vertically bisected by Amande, a door homie whose face was carved out, and both Prometheus and Zeus, who have been harmed by Brook, Jinbe and Zoro despite their intangible, elemental compositions. If homies experience extreme fear, they will instantly die and wither away. Another consequence of the living nature of homies is that the user of the Soru Soru no Mi can only control them if their commands to them are audible. \nWhile the homies are typically subservient to the user and will not ordinarily defy them, they do possess their own minds and can turn against their creator if motivated enough; even special homies created by the user's own soul can be coerced into switching loyalty. Homies cannot attack anything infused with the user's soul, such as the user's Vivre Card, even if such an object is in the hands of an enemy, and in fact must obey the owner of the Vivre Card; although this can be overridden when the user themselves is present to give orders directly to the homies. \nHomies created from others' souls are also weak to the soul mastery allowed by the Yomi Yomi no Mi and will faint against its user if they exude the energies from their own soul, although powerful homies created from the Soru Soru no Mi's user's own soul are immune to this. \nWhen a soul is implanted into a homie, it will possess the memories of the person the soul belonged to. If those memories are recalled or manipulated through a method like the Memo Memo no Mi, the homie will proceed to carry out the details of the memories, confusing and distracting them. While the homies are in this state, the user of the Soru Soru no Mi will be unable to control them. The user also has to be in their right state of mind in order to properly control the homies. Otherwise, they may be more vulnerable to being manipulated or distracted by outside influences. \nA soul fragment will inhabit whatever object it first makes contact with. Thus, if the user is not careful as to where a soul fragment is placed, it could be absorbed by something they did not intend for. This was seen when Big Mom tossed Zeus' disembodied soul toward Hera with the intention of her eating it; however, due to the close proximity of Nami's Sorcery Clima-Tact, Zeus' soul went in the Clima-Tact instead. \nAdditionally, if the user cannot speak out any command, should they be prevented by it, the homies cannot issue the orders the user gives them. This was seen when Big Mom was silenced by Trafalgar Law's Silent Room ability and could not command Misery to attack him, leaving Misery without a clear order and aim to attack. \nOtherwise, the user experiences the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses to water and Seastone.

The fruit's powers also extend to whatever items or clothing are on the user's person; this was very apparent when a chunk of rubble simply bounced off Alvida's body despite the fact that it hit her while she was still wearing her coat. \nAs a side effect of the fruit's power, all of the eater's excess fat \"slips off\", granting them a much skinnier physique. Despite this, the user seems to retain their full strength, as Alvida can still wield her iron mace with ease. This loss of fat appears to be permanent, as Alvida did not revert to her previous appearance upon coming into contact with Seastone, which negates the effects of Devil Fruits. \nWhile the fruit's powers render the user literally untouchable, they can still be affected by certain things. For example, Smoker was able to restrain Alvida, along with Buggy and his crew, by summoning smoke around them using his Devil Fruit powers.

These special homies are Napoleon the bicorne, Prometheus the sun and Zeus the thundercloud. The latter two can be used to produce massive amounts of fire or electricity, and can also combine their powers to create great storms, granting Big Mom control over the weather. In addition, Big Mom can use either of these two homies to fly around or enhance the power of her melee attacks by merging their respective elements with either her bare hands (such as her Raitei technique) or Napoleon in his sword form (such as her Cognac technique). Prometheus in particular has also shown the ability to fuse with Big Mom's hair, becoming a flaming mane. Napoleon is a bicorne that Big Mom wears on her head at all times, except when sleeping, who can receive telepathic signals from other nearby homies and relay the information to Big Mom. Napoleon can also reveal a blade and hilt to transform into a sword with devastating offensive power, being able to both attack on its own and be wielded by Big Mom as her personal weapon. \nDespite each of Big Mom's special homies being extremely strong on their own, Zeus' carefree nature often led him to act in ways that hindered Big Mom, such as when he was temporarily swayed by Nami due to her feeding him thunderclouds, and later chose to willingly join her. This often led his fellow special homies to treat him with disdain and consider him a burden. Although Big Mom managed to reclaim Zeus during the war at Onigashima, after once again being hindered by him, Big Mom became fed up with Zeus' incompetence and, at Prometheus' suggestion, used a piece of her soul to create a new thundercloud special homie named Hera to replace him. Hera turned out to be more in-sync with her fellow special homies than Zeus ever was, allowing the three of them to unleash more complex moves that, according to Prometheus, were previously impossible due to Zeus' general foolishness. Big Mom later ordered Hera to consume Zeus in order to merge the two pieces of her soul together and increase Hera's power. When Zeus attempted to rebel against Big Mom, he was picked up by the Emperor and had his soul extracted from his body, weakening him and allowing Hera to devour him unimpeded. Zeus' soul fragment, however, successfully escaped into Nami's Sorcery Clima-Tact, granting him a new body. "}

This allows them to land crushing attacks that can easily crack the ground and even break the bones of giants. \nThe fruit is superior to the Kiro Kiro no Mi, since while both fruits revolve around the manipulation of body weight, the user of the Ton Ton no Mi can become much heavier than the Kiro Kiro no Mi's maximum of 10,000 kilograms. The lowest weight shown is ten tonnes (equivalent to ten thousand kilograms) and the highest weight shown is 10,000 tonnes (equivalent to ten million kilograms). The user's weight can also be supplemented by holding other heavy objects, as Machvise sometimes crushes his opponents while holding a large shield. \nThe fruit has not been stated or shown to be able to make the user lighter than their usual weight like the Kiro Kiro no Mi can. However, it still grants the user the ability to float in the air almost as if they were weightless. \nThe fruit's power will prove ineffective should an opponent be capable of withstanding the selected weight, and can even use the force of the weight against the user, as shown when Hajrudin, a giant, defeated Machvise. Also, as the user is unable to manipulate the trajectory of their fall, any opponent sufficiently fast can dodge the attacks with relative ease. Missing the target will also mean landing on hard ground, and unlike the Kiro Kiro no Mi the user of this fruit is not protected by the impact of their own attacks; Machvise complained of a stomachache when his attack missed Franky, causing him to land on hard ground on his stomach.  Likely to prevent harming himself this way, Machvise often holds onto a shield to protect himself. The sheer force of the impact may cause unwanted collateral damage to the ground. \nLastly, since the user is only given crushing-based techniques, this fruit's power is rendered completely ineffective against eaters of the Gomu Gomu no Mi, as the latter's body has rubber-like properties and is therefore unaffected by blunt attacks. Other than that, the user is affected by the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses. "}

At its most basic, the straw can serve as a holding device as well as act as sharp weapon. By producing a larger amount of straw, the user can cover themselves in it to enhance their fighting capabilities or create a large straw monster with which to attack their foes. When using these techniques, the user is also seemingly able to manifest nails and use them as accompanying weapons. \nAs a more advanced technique, the user is also capable of creating small straw dolls and storing them inside their body. Each doll, through unknown means, can be linked to and represents another person akin to a voodoo doll. Consequently, if the user is injured in any way, the damage is instead transferred to a given doll and in turn whichever person it represents. This allows the user to easily survive and recover from multiple life-threatening injuries if they have enough dolls in store, making them difficult to defeat. It was also shown that effects that do not directly hurt or injure the user, such as the effects of the Ope Ope no Mi, can be transferred to other people as well. While the exact process is unclear, the user is capable of specifically choosing which person a straw doll is tied to. Thus, the user is capable of gaining a massive advantage in battle if they manage to connect their dolls to their opponents' allies, rendering the opponent unable to harm them without first killing one or more comrades. The user can further take advantage of tying an enemy's body to a doll by inflicting harm on themselves. \nIn regard to the straw doll technique, the user can only carry a maximum of ten dolls in their body, leaving the user vulnerable to taking damage once every doll is lost. Moreover, if the person the doll represents suffers damage through other means, the doll is damaged too, leaving it unusable. Rapid consecutive attacks, in particular, can swiftly deplete an entire supply of Straw Men, as Kizaru proved. Additionally, if damage inflicted on the fruit user cannot be applied to the person the doll is connected to, the damage will not transfer and the user will be wounded. This was shown when Killer managed to sever Hawkins' left arm while the latter was transferring damage to Eustass Kid, since Kid had lost his own left arm during the timeskip and uses a prosthetic made with his own Devil Fruit, meaning the damage transfer was rendered void. Moreover, the straw dolls can be removed manually from the user's body should an enemy somehow manage to get ahold of them, cancelling the link between the user and their target. \nThe straw created by the fruit's power does not appear to be very durable, as Roronoa Zoro could easily slice through it. Aside from creating openings in their body to release the straw dolls, the user is incapable of turning their bodies into straw like a Logia, and thus cannot make attacks pass through them. Other than that, it has all the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses. "}

When reading someone's fortune, he will sometimes summon thin straw threads to keep his cards at eye level. Post-timeskip, however, he has more or less dropped this practice, keeping his cards afloat in mid-air through unknown means instead. \nHawkins tends to keep straw dolls representing other people inside of him, as a form of general protection against sudden enemies. These dolls can redirect a single instance of damage that he receives towards the person they are linked to, regenerating the corresponding damage that Hawkins took and leaving him practically unscathed as though it never even happened. How exactly Hawkins manages to link his life with those of others is still a mystery. Thanks to the nature of Hawkins' straw dolls, he can use the lives of people his enemies care about as a bargaining chip in order to attain an advantageous deal or circumstance. Hawkins also finds amusement in making his foes figure out ways to get around his powers, even if letting them unknowingly injure whomever he is linked to would be a more pragmatic and beneficial strategy. \nFor offense, Hawkins can either transform into a large scarecrow-like creature with nail claws or summon an even larger straw entity to fight on his behalf.

{"id": 86, "url": "https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Yomi_Yomi_no_Mi", "category": {"category": "devil_fruits", "title": "Yomi Yomi no Mi"}, "text": "[Strengths and Weaknesses of Yomi Yomi no Mi]\n\nThe major strength of the fruit, as demonstrated by Brook, is that it gives its user another chance at life after dying once before and thereby a literal second chance at living. After death, the user continues to exist in whatever state they were revived as and can even go as far as to grant a form of \"immortality\" that lasts until the user suffers a second death. However, since the main attribute of the fruit is resurrection, the Yomi Yomi no Mi's power will remain dormant until the time when the consumer suffers his or her first death. As a result, until such time, the only aspects the fruit bestows upon its eater are the typical Devil Fruit weaknesses. \nWhile the Fruit allows the user's soul to once again return from the afterlife, it does not automatically return them to the physical body that it once resided in during its mortal life. Thus, it is then up to the disembodied soul to search for the corporeal body in order to once again reunite with it. Though the user gains another life, their body however will continue being a lifeless corpse and will continue rotting away until the user's soul can find its way back to the body. When the user's soul returns to their body, the powers of the Devil Fruit will fortunately support the user's well being in the case that their body may be in a condition unable to support life. \nWhile the fruit can make the user an undead being of sorts, it however grants the user the ability to still feel pain as proof that they have been truly resurrected back to life, regardless of what physical condition they've been revived in. This is noteworthy because it separates the power of the Yomi Yomi no Mi from the zombies created by the Kage Kage no Mi because although both powers work to make the dead come \"alive\" again, the Kage Kage no Mi zombies do not feel pain because they are not truly \"alive\" at all. However, the susceptibility to sensation seems to be selective, since Brook was able to traverse Punk Hazard's frozen terrain without any signs of discomfort, while the rest of the Straw Hats were shivering in comparison. Earlier during their travel to Fish-Man Island, he did chill at the ocean level. It may possibly be that Brook is immune to damage that is based on impacting one's tissue as he carried a petrified Kin'emon out of the new H2S compound without much incident, or before, when one of Smiley's blobs hissed gas on his face, he wasn't affected (he acted as his eyes were itching until he remembered he didn't have eyeballs anymore). It has been shown that sleeping gas does affect him as he was knockout when the crew arrive at Punk Hazard. Another case of this comes from Brook showcasing immunity towards electrocution at least in two different occasions. \nBrook demonstrated a new power of his Devil Fruit on Fish-Man Island after the timeskip. Brook's soul that came back to inhabit his skeleton is still able to leave the body, usually by exiting his mouth, similar to astral projection, and move it everywhere he wants to. It can even pass through walls, similar to Perona's own astral projection power. In the anime it was shown as Brook saying the word \"bone\" multiple times like a mantra of some sort and then his spectral form leaves through his mouth, leaving his body seemingly colorless. \nWhen Brook is in spectral form, it mostly resembles his skeletal face (complete with the omega letter-shaped crack across his forehead) and is engulfed in spiritual flames; it appears to be not only visible but also audible to both people and animals since Zoro and Usopp were seen being able to converse with Brook while in this form, and Pappag was shown scampering away from Brook in this state, mistaking the skeleton's soul as a ghost, therefore frightening the starfish. It is currently unknown as to how far the extent can Brook maintain this separation of his soul from his body, or if there are any limits about it at all (i.e., when Perona uses her own spectral form, she leaves her corporeal body dormant). However, the main weakness to this ability is that while Brook has his soul out of his body, he cannot use or move his physical body and has to have someone guard him so that Brook won't be harmed. \nDuring his fight with Zeo, Brook reveals that in the past two years he has come to know the true power of his Devil Fruit. The soul of a human that died is supposed to go to the land of the dead and stay there, but for his soul to exist in the human world it emits a powerful energy. Therefore, the power that allows him to live in the human world is neither organs or muscles, but rather his soul; the fruit's influence enhances such to make the impossible possible. As long as his bones are not hurt, any attacks will not go to his core. When Zeo beheaded Brook, his soul managed to repair it and connect his bones together again. He has also displayed that he can transfer this energy to an object like his cane sword in which he summons the Chill of the Underworld (黄泉の冷気, Yomi no Reiki?), allowing him to freeze his opponent with ice created from his soul's energy. Lastly, he has stated that he can feel the souls of others and, when mixed with his music, is able to move them. \nThis fruit also gives the user certain advantages over the user of the Soru Soru no Mi; Brook is capable of using the raw energy and presence of his own powerful soul to overwhelm the homies due to them being created from small pieces of souls that do not belong to them. The effects of this are visually similar to Haoshoku Haki; it renders the homies unconscious and immobile. This advantage is decreased against homies made from Big Mom's own soul, as Brook cannot overwhelm them, but he is capable of injuring them as well. "}

The ability user is able to move about living things and objects with little effort, ranging from debris to send flying against an enemy in smaller or massive numbers, to a massive battleship. The range of the generable gravity field appears incredibly big, as it can pull down meteors from the highest of skies (possibly the outer atmosphere, or even space itself). \nAble to have their gravity go in any direction, even horizontal, as demonstrated by Fujitora, the user can move about matter with precision, effectively granting a form of telekinesis. By negating natural gravity and forcing things upward to navigate in midair, flight can be simulated, as shown by Fujitora making either himself fly on a small rock platform or levitate himself alongside his men on a ship. He is also able to manipulate multiple different gravity fields simultaneously, as seen when fighting Luffy at the end of Dressrosa Arc, where he kept vast amounts of rubble floating across an island-wide scale while attacking him with offensive gravity wells. \nHowever, it seems that his gravity powers can be disrupted by attacking Fujitora himself, shown when Roronoa Zoro used a projectile slash to interrupt the admiral from keeping him held in a gravitational pin, enabling Zoro to escape from it. Additionally, people and objects are capable of resisting the gravity if they are physically strong enough to maintain a hold on their current location.

Prominently in battle, Fujitora is seen employing downforces of gravity to press opposition against the ground with varying degrees of power, from using such heavy force as to crack, cave in, and deeply crater the earth as well as keep physical powerhouses fully restrained (or just barely able to move, let alone stand) to using just enough gravity to keep a physically weakened person pinned down and immobilized. Another feat that is seen done repeatedly by the admiral is the summoning of meteorites from high up in the sky (though unknown from how far), even if just as a \"test\" of his abilities. \nApart from that, Fujitora can reverse the flow of gravity to create an attack-repelling field around him, akin to a circular barrier. He can also, by negating the normal downforce of gravity, levitate free-lying objects around him and control them, even incredibly huge amounts, such as when he had rubble float up high across the entire island of Dressrosa. If targeting fewer objects to make float, his precision increases, shown when he uses his ability to move through the air such materials as a battleship or rock platform to stand on and fly. Though this power of levitation resembles that of the Fuwa Fuwa no Mi used by Shiki, unlike the latter, Fujitora is not hindered by the necessity of having to touch a given target beforehand, and he can target both the living and inanimate.

Through the fruit's powers, Brook is able to function without the presence of necessary and vital body parts that have decomposed long ago. He is able to interact with the environment around him without the presence of eyeballs or any other sensory organ to aid him. He, in particular, retains his ability of speech despite his vocal cords and even his windpipe having long since rotted away. He is able to taste and digest food like any other normal living thing to sustain himself. Drinking milk in particular heals him as the calcium intake repairs any of Brook's bones that may have been broken in battle. Depending on the situation, Brook is also able to produce organic matter such as tears, fecal matter, and even blood from his nose despite not having any organs nor bodily liquids to produce such matter. \nBrook is able to move and stand up without the presence of tissue and muscles to support him, as well as be capable of getting tired or worn down despite not having any of those factors to begin with. Due to the fruit's powers holding up and moving his light skeletal frame, Brook is given an extremely light body. He can perform seemingly superhuman feats such as jumping extremely high and running on water. These allow him to travel great distances and aid him in battle. However, while his light body lets him be lighter than an average person, Brook is not immune from sinking. Brook will still sink like any other Devil Fruit user when placed in water. In fact, while Brook can run on water, he cannot stay above it too long. \nBeing a skeleton animated by the fruit's powers also allows Brook to do things that most other people cannot do due to their need of tangible living tissue. Not only is he able to use his light weight to execute fast attacks, but his lack of flesh also allows him to execute attacks that would otherwise be harmful, such as shocking himself with electricity and becoming an electrically charged projectile. Having no flesh and organs gives Brook a great advantage against carnivores, even though it will still make him angry, such as a dragon at Punk Hazard, the dragon was chasing Brook, but since he was only bones, the dragon ignored him, and Brook got really mad. On the contrary, canine minks who love to gnaw on bones tend to chase after him due to his physiology. Due to the lack of organs, Brook is able to withstand some deadly attacks to a certain degree. For instance, he was able to withstand his skull being shattered and several of his ribs broken. Also, due to the Devil Fruit powers allowing it, Brook has the ability to store objects in his skull by opening it along its crack. \nWhile Brook is able to do these things because of his Devil Fruit supported form, he however can still feel pain, as well as fatigue. However, the fact that he lacks the actual organs means that Brook can fore-go most of the necessities required by humans (i.e., eating, breathing, etc.), having stayed up on his old ship for a long time with nothing to sustain himself with. Based on his own statements and comments from others, despite the lack of any muscles, it appears that he is able to grow stronger through normal training. Though Brook is able to repair broken bones, he believes that all growth functions have stopped. For this reason, Brook puts a lot of effort into protecting his afro, since he would be unable to grow it again if it were cut. However, Brook's belief was incorrect, as he grew 11 cm during the two years he was separated from the crew. \nAfter developing the ability to remove his soul from his body, Brook uses the intangibility to his advantage to peek at women, as well as escape imprisonment of any kind while contacting other people for assistance and scouting out things. \nAfter two years of training, Brook has mastered the use of this Devil Fruit to the extent of knowing its true nature. He reveals that in order for his soul to remain here in this world, it produces a unique and powerful energy that is almost physical in form. He has also mastered the energy his soul emits to the extent that he can reattach his bones by using this energy. Brook can engulf objects such as his sword with this energy and thereby summon the Chill of the Underworld. "}
